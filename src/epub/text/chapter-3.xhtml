<h2>
<span>III.</span>
<span>GRENDEL THE MURDERER.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.III.1">When the sun was sunken, he set out to visit</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.2">The lofty hall-building, how the Ring-Danes had used it</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.3">For beds and benches when the banquet was over.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.4">Then he found there reposing many a noble</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.5">Asleep after supper; sorrow the heroes,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.6">Misery knew not. The monster of evil</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.7">Greedy and cruel tarried but little,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.8">Fell and frantic, and forced from their slumbers</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.9">Thirty of thanemen; thence he departed</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.10">Leaping and laughing, his lair to return to,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.11">With surfeit of slaughter sallying homeward.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.12">In the dusk of the dawning, as the day was just breaking,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.13">Was Grendel’s prowess revealed to the warriors:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.14">Then, his meal-taking finished, a moan was uplifted,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.15">Morning-cry mighty. The man-ruler famous,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.16">The long-worthy atheling, sat very woful,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.17">Suffered great sorrow, sighed for his liegemen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.18">When they had seen the track of the hateful pursuer,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.19">The spirit accursèd: too crushing that sorrow,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.20">Too loathsome and lasting. Not longer he tarried,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.21">But one night after continued his slaughter</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.22">Shameless and shocking, shrinking but little</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.23">From malice and murder; they mastered him fully.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.24">He was easy to find then who otherwhere looked for</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.25">A pleasanter place of repose in the lodges,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.26">A bed in the bowers. Then was brought to his notice</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.27">Told him truly by token apparent</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.28">The hall-thane’s hatred: he held himself after</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.29">Further and faster who the foeman did baffle.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.30">So ruled he and strongly strove against justice</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.31">Lone against all men, till empty uptowered</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.32">The choicest of houses. Long was the season:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.33">Twelve-winters’ time torture suffered</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.34">The friend of the Scyldings, every affliction,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.35">Endless agony; hence it after became</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.36">Certainly known to the children of men</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.37">Sadly in measures, that long against Hrothgar</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.38">Grendel struggled:—his grudges he cherished,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.39">Murderous malice, many a winter,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.40">Strife unremitting, and peacefully wished he</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.41">Life-woe to lift from no liegeman at all of</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.42">The men of the Dane-folk, for money to settle,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.43">No counsellor needed count for a moment</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.44">On handsome amends at the hands of the murderer;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.45">The monster of evil fiercely did harass,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.46">The ill-planning death-shade, both elder and younger,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.47">Trapping and tricking them. He trod every night then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.48">The mist-covered moor-fens; men do not know where</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.49">Witches and wizards wander and ramble.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.50">So the foe of mankind many of evils</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.51">Grievous injuries, often accomplished,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.52">Horrible hermit; Heort he frequented,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.53">Gem-bedecked palace, when night-shades had fallen</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.54">(Since God did oppose him, not the throne could he touch,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.55">The light-flashing jewel, love of Him knew not).</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.56">’Twas a fearful affliction to the friend of the Scyldings</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.57">Soul-crushing sorrow. Not seldom in private</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.58">Sat the king in his council; conference held they</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.59">What the braves should determine ’gainst terrors unlooked for.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.60">At the shrines of their idols often they promised</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.61">Gifts and offerings, earnestly prayed they</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.62">The devil from hell would help them to lighten</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.63">Their people’s oppression. Such practice they used then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.64">Hope of the heathen; hell they remembered</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.65">In innermost spirit, God they knew not,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.66">Judge of their actions, All-wielding Ruler,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.67">No praise could they give the Guardian of Heaven,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.68">The Wielder of Glory. Woe will be his who</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.69">Through furious hatred his spirit shall drive to</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.70">The clutch of the fire, no comfort shall look for,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.71">Wax no wiser; well for the man who,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.72">Living his life-days, his Lord may face</div>
<div class="l" id="L.III.73">And find defence in his Father’s embrace!</div>
