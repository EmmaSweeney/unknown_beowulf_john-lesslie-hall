<span>XLI.</span>
<span>THE MESSENGER’S RETROSPECT.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.1">“The blood-stainèd trace of Swedes and Geatmen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.2">The death-rush of warmen, widely was noticed,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.3">How the folks with each other feud did awaken.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.4">The worthy one went then with well-beloved comrades,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.5">Old and dejected to go to the fastness,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.6">Ongentheo earl upward then turned him;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.7">Of Higelac’s battle he’d heard on inquiry,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.8">The exultant one’s prowess, despaired of resistance,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.9">With earls of the ocean to be able to struggle,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.10">’Gainst sea-going sailors to save the hoard-treasure,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.11">His wife and his children; he fled after thenceward</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.12">Old ’neath the earth-wall. Then was offered pursuance</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.13">To the braves of the Swedemen, the banner to Higelac.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.14">They fared then forth o’er the field-of-protection,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.15">When the Hrethling heroes hedgeward had thronged them.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.16">Then with edges of irons was Ongentheow driven,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.17">The gray-haired to tarry, that the troop-ruler had to</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.18">Suffer the power solely of Eofor:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.19">Wulf then wildly with weapon assaulted him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.20">Wonred his son, that for swinge of the edges</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.21">The blood from his body burst out in currents,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.22">Forth ’neath his hair. He feared not however,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.23">Gray-headed Scylfing, but speedily quited</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.24">The wasting wound-stroke with worse exchange,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.25">When the king of the thane-troop thither did turn him:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.26">The wise-mooded son of Wonred was powerless</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.27">To give a return-blow to the age-hoary man,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.28">But his head-shielding helmet first hewed he to pieces,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.29">That flecked with gore perforce he did totter,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.30">Fell to the earth; not fey was he yet then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.31">But up did he spring though an edge-wound had reached him.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.32">Then Higelac’s vassal, valiant and dauntless,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.33">When his brother lay dead, made his broad-bladed weapon,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.34">Giant-sword ancient, defence of the giants,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.35">Bound o’er the shield-wall; the folk-prince succumbed then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.36">Shepherd of people, was pierced to the vitals.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.37">There were many attendants who bound up his kinsman,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.38">Carried him quickly when occasion was granted</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.39">That the place of the slain they were suffered to manage.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.40">This pending, one hero plundered the other,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.41">His armor of iron from Ongentheow ravished,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.42">His hard-sword hilted and helmet together;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.43">The old one’s equipments he carried to Higelac.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.44">He the jewels received, and rewards ’mid the troopers</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.45">Graciously promised, and so did accomplish:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.46">The king of the Weders requited the war-rush,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.47">Hrethel’s descendant, when home he repaired him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.48">To Eofor and Wulf with wide-lavished treasures,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.49">To each of them granted a hundred of thousands</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.50">In land and rings wrought out of wire:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.51">None upon mid-earth needed to twit him</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.52">With the gifts he gave them, when glory they conquered;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.53">And to Eofor then gave he his one only daughter,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.54">The honor of home, as an earnest of favor.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.55">That’s the feud and hatred—as ween I ’twill happen—</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.56">The anger of earthmen, that earls of the Swedemen</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.57">Will visit on us, when they hear that our leader</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.58">Lifeless is lying, he who longtime protected</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.59">His hoard and kingdom ’gainst hating assailers,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.60">Who on the fall of the heroes defended of yore</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.61">The deed-mighty Scyldings, did for the troopers</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.62">What best did avail them, and further moreover</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.63">Hero-deeds ’complished.  Now is haste most fitting,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.64">That the lord of liegemen we look upon yonder,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.65">And <i>that</i> one carry on journey to death-pyre</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.66">Who ring-presents gave us. Not aught of it all</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.67">Shall melt with the brave one—there’s a mass of bright jewels,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.68">Gold beyond measure, grewsomely purchased</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.69">And ending it all ornament-rings too</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.70">Bought with his life; these fire shall devour,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.71">Flame shall cover, no earlman shall wear</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.72">A jewel-memento, nor beautiful virgin</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.73">Have on her neck rings to adorn her,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.74">But wretched in spirit bereavèd of gold-gems</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.75">She shall oft with others be exiled and banished,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.76">Since the leader of liegemen hath laughter forsaken,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.77">Mirth and merriment. Hence many a war-spear</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.78">Cold from the morning shall be clutched in the fingers,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.79">Heaved in the hand, no harp-music’s sound shall</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.80">Waken the warriors, but the wan-coated raven</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.81">Fain over fey ones freely shall gabble,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.82">Shall say to the eagle how he sped in the eating,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.83">When, the wolf his companion, he plundered the slain.”</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.84">So the high-minded hero was rehearsing these stories</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.85">Loathsome to hear; he lied as to few of</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.86">Weirds and of words. All the war-troop arose then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.87">’Neath the Eagle’s Cape sadly betook them,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.88">Weeping and woful, the wonder to look at.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.89">They saw on the sand then soulless a-lying,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.90">His slaughter-bed holding, him who rings had given them</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.91">In days that were done; then the death-bringing moment</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.92">Was come to the good one, that the king very warlike,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.93">Wielder of Weders, with wonder-death perished.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.94">First they beheld there a creature more wondrous,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.95">The worm on the field, in front of them lying,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.96">The foeman before them: the fire-spewing dragon,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.97">Ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.98">Was scorched in the fire; as he lay there he measured</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.99">Fifty of feet; came forth in the night-time</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.100">To rejoice in the air, thereafter departing</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.101">To visit his den; he in death was then fastened,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.102">He would joy in no other earth-hollowed caverns.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.103">There stood round about him beakers and vessels,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.104">Dishes were lying and dear-valued weapons,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.105">With iron-rust eaten, as in earth’s mighty bosom</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.106">A thousand of winters there they had rested:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.107">That mighty bequest then with magic was guarded,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.108">Gold of the ancients, that earlman not any</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.109">The ring-hall could touch, save Ruling-God only,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.110">Sooth-king of Vict’ries gave whom He wished to</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.111">(He is earth-folk’s protector) to open the treasure,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XLI.112">E’en to such among mortals as seemed to Him proper.</div>
