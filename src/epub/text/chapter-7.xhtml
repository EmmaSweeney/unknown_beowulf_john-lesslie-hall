				<p>					<span>Hrothgar answered, helm of the Scyldings:</span>
					<span>“I remember this man as the merest of striplings.</span>
					<span>His father long dead now was Ecgtheow titled,</span>
					<span>Him Hrethel the Geatman granted at home his</span>
					<span>One only daughter; his battle-brave son</span>
					<span>Is come but now, sought a trustworthy friend.</span>
					<span>Seafaring sailors asserted it then,</span>
					<span>Who valuable gift-gems of the Geatmen carried</span>
					<span>As peace-offering thither, that he thirty men’s grapple</span>
					<span>Has in his hand, the hero-in-battle.</span>
					<span>The holy Creator usward sent him,</span>
					<span>To West-Dane warriors, I ween, for to render</span>
					<span>’Gainst Grendel’s grimness gracious assistance:</span>
					<span>I shall give to the good one gift-gems for courage.</span>
					<span>Hasten to bid them hither to speed them,</span>
					<span>To see assembled this circle of kinsmen;</span>
					<span>Tell them expressly they’re welcome in sooth to</span>
					<span>The men of the Danes.” To the door of the building</span>
					<span>Wulfgar went then, this word-message shouted:</span>
					<span>“My victorious liegelord bade me to tell you,</span>
					<span>The East-Danes’ atheling, that your origin knows he,</span>
					<span>And o’er wave-billows wafted ye welcome are hither,</span>
					<span>Valiant of spirit. Ye straightway may enter</span>
					<span>Clad in corslets, cased in your helmets,</span>
					<span>To see King Hrothgar. Here let your battle-boards,</span>
					<span>Wood-spears and war-shafts, await your conferring.”</span>
					<span>The mighty one rose then, with many a liegeman,</span>
					<span>An excellent thane-group; some there did await them,</span>
					<span>And as bid of the brave one the battle-gear guarded.</span>
					<span>Together they hied them, while the hero did guide them,</span>
					<span>’Neath Heorot’s roof; the high-minded went then</span>
					<span>Sturdy ’neath helmet till he stood in the building.</span>
					<span>Beowulf spake (his burnie did glisten,</span>
					<span>His armor seamed over by the art of the craftsman):</span>
					<span>“Hail thou, Hrothgar! I am Higelac’s kinsman</span>
					<span>And vassal forsooth; many a wonder</span>
					<span>I dared as a stripling. The doings of Grendel,</span>
					<span>In far-off fatherland I fully did know of:</span>
					<span>Sea-farers tell us, this hall-building standeth,</span>
					<span>Excellent edifice, empty and useless</span>
					<span>To all the earlmen after evenlight’s glimmer</span>
					<span>’Neath heaven’s bright hues hath hidden its glory.</span>
					<span>This my earls then urged me, the most excellent of them,</span>
					<span>Carles very clever, to come and assist thee,</span>
					<span>Folk-leader Hrothgar; fully they knew of</span>
					<span>The strength of my body. Themselves they beheld me</span>
					<span>When I came from the contest, when covered with gore</span>
					<span>Foes I escaped from, where five I had bound,</span>
					<span>The giant-race wasted, in the waters destroying</span>
					<span>The nickers by night, bore numberless sorrows,</span>
					<span>The Weders avenged (woes had they suffered)</span>
					<span>Enemies ravaged; alone now with Grendel</span>
					<span>I shall manage the matter, with the monster of evil,</span>
					<span>The giant, decide it. Thee I would therefore</span>
					<span>Beg of thy bounty, Bright-Danish chieftain,</span>
					<span>Lord of the Scyldings, this single petition:</span>
					<span>Not to refuse me, defender of warriors,</span>
					<span>Friend-lord of folks, so far have I sought thee,</span>
					<span>That <em>I</em> may unaided, my earlmen assisting me,</span>
					<span>This brave-mooded war-band, purify Heorot.</span>
					<span>I have heard on inquiry, the horrible creature</span>
					<span>From veriest rashness recks not for weapons;</span>
					<span>I this do scorn then, so be Higelac gracious,</span>
					<span>My liegelord belovèd, lenient of spirit,</span>
					<span>To bear a blade or a broad-fashioned target,</span>
					<span>A shield to the onset; only with hand-grip</span>
					<span>The foe I must grapple, fight for my life then,</span>
					<span>Foeman with foeman; he fain must rely on</span>
					<span>The doom of the Lord whom death layeth hold of.</span>
					<span>I ween he will wish, if he win in the struggle,</span>
					<span>To eat in the war-hall earls of the Geat-folk,</span>
					<span>Boldly to swallow them, as of yore he did often</span>
					<span>The best of the Hrethmen! Thou needest not trouble</span>
					<span>A head-watch to give me; he will have me dripping</span>
					<span>And dreary with gore, if death overtake me,</span>
					<span>Will bear me off bleeding, biting and mouthing me,</span>
					<span>The hermit will eat me, heedless of pity,</span>
					<span>Marking the moor-fens; no more wilt thou need then</span>
					<span>Find me my food. If I fall in the battle,</span>
					<span>Send to Higelac the armor that serveth</span>
					<span>To shield my bosom, the best of equipments,</span>
					<span>Richest of ring-mails; ’tis the relic of Hrethla,</span>
					<span>The work of Wayland. Goes Weird as she must go!”</span>
