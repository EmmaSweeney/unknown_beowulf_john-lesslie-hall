<span>XXXIV.</span>
<span>BEOWULF SEEKS THE DRAGON.—BEOWULF’S REMINISCENCES.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.1">He planned requital for the folk-leader’s ruin</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.2">In days thereafter, to Eadgils the wretched</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.3">Becoming an enemy. Ohthere’s son then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.4">Went with a war-troop o’er the wide-stretching currents</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.5">With warriors and weapons: with woe-journeys cold he</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.6">After avenged him, the king’s life he took.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.7">So he came off uninjured from all of his battles,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.8">Perilous fights, offspring of Ecgtheow,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.9">From his deeds of daring, till that day most momentous</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.10">When he fate-driven fared to fight with the dragon.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.11">With eleven companions the prince of the Geatmen</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.12">Went lowering with fury to look at the fire-drake:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.13">Inquiring he’d found how the feud had arisen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.14">Hate to his heroes; the highly-famed gem-vessel</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.15">Was brought to his keeping through the hand of th’ informer.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.16">That in the throng was thirteenth of heroes,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.17">That caused the beginning of conflict so bitter,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.18">Captive and wretched, must sad-mooded thenceward</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.19">Point out the place: he passed then unwillingly</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.20">To the spot where he knew of the notable cavern,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.21">The cave under earth, not far from the ocean,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.22">The anger of eddies, which inward was full of</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.23">Jewels and wires: a warden uncanny,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.24">Warrior weaponed, wardered the treasure,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.25">Old under earth; no easy possession</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.26">For any of earth-folk access to get to.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.27">Then the battle-brave atheling sat on the naze-edge,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.28">While the gold-friend of Geatmen gracious saluted</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.29">His fireside-companions: woe was his spirit,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.30">Death-boding, wav’ring; Weird very near him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.31">Who must seize the old hero, his soul-treasure look for,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.32">Dragging aloof his life from his body:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.33">Not flesh-hidden long was the folk-leader’s spirit.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.34">Beowulf spake, Ecgtheow’s son:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.35">“I survived in my youth-days many a conflict,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.36">Hours of onset: that all I remember.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.37">I was seven-winters old when the jewel-prince took me,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.38">High-lord of heroes, at the hands of my father,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.39">Hrethel the hero-king had me in keeping,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.40">Gave me treasure and feasting, our kinship remembered;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.41">Not ever was I <i>any</i> less dear to him</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.42">Knight in the boroughs, than the bairns of his household,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.43">Herebald and Hæthcyn and Higelac mine.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.44">To the eldest unjustly by acts of a kinsman</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.45">Was murder-bed strewn, since him Hæthcyn from horn-bow</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.46">His sheltering chieftain shot with an arrow,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.47">Erred in his aim and injured his kinsman,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.48">One brother the other, with blood-sprinkled spear:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.49">’Twas a feeless fight, finished in malice,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.50">Sad to his spirit; the folk-prince however</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.51">Had to part from existence with vengeance untaken.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.52">So to hoar-headed hero ’tis heavily crushing</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.53">To live to see his son as he rideth</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.54">Young on the gallows: then measures he chanteth,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.55">A song of sorrow, when his son is hanging</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.56">For the raven’s delight, and aged and hoary</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.57">He is unable to offer any assistance.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.58">Every morning his offspring’s departure</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.59">Is constant recalled: he cares not to wait for</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.60">The birth of an heir in his borough-enclosures,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.61">Since that one through death-pain the deeds hath experienced.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.62">He heart-grieved beholds in the house of his son the</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.63">Wine-building wasted, the wind-lodging places</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.64">Reaved of their roaring; the riders are sleeping,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.65">The knights in the grave; there’s no sound of the harp-wood,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIV.66">Joy in the yards, as of yore were familiar.</div>
