				<p>					<span>The folk of the Geatmen got him then ready</span>
					<span>A pile on the earth strong for the burning,</span>
					<span>Behung with helmets, hero-knights’ targets,</span>
					<span>And bright-shining burnies, as he begged they should have them;</span>
					<span>Then wailing war-heroes their world-famous chieftain,</span>
					<span>Their liegelord beloved, laid in the middle.</span>
					<span>Soldiers began then to make on the barrow</span>
					<span>The largest of dead-fires: dark o’er the vapor</span>
					<span>The smoke-cloud ascended, the sad-roaring fire,</span>
					<span>Mingled with weeping (the wind-roar subsided)</span>
					<span>Till the building of bone it had broken to pieces,</span>
					<span>Hot in the heart. Heavy in spirit</span>
					<span>They mood-sad lamented the men-leader’s ruin;</span>
					<span>And mournful measures the much-grieving widow</span>
					<span>* * * * * * *</span>
					<span>* * * * * * *</span>
					<span>* * * * * * *</span>
					<span>* * * * * * *</span>
					<span>* * * * * * *</span>
					<span>* * * * * * *</span>
					<span>The men of the Weders made accordingly</span>
					<span>A hill on the height, high and extensive,</span>
					<span>Of sea-going sailors to be seen from a distance,</span>
					<span>And the brave one’s beacon built where the fire was,</span>
					<span>In ten-days’ space, with a wall surrounded it,</span>
					<span>As wisest of world-folk could most worthily plan it.</span>
					<span>They placed in the barrow rings and jewels,</span>
					<span>All such ornaments as erst in the treasure</span>
					<span>War-mooded men had won in possession:</span>
					<span>The earnings of earlmen to earth they entrusted,</span>
					<span>The gold to the dust, where yet it remaineth</span>
					<span>As useless to mortals as in foregoing eras.</span>
					<span>’Round the dead-mound rode then the doughty-in-battle,</span>
					<span>Bairns of all twelve of the chiefs of the people,</span>
					<span>More would they mourn, lament for their ruler,</span>
					<span>Speak in measure, mention him with pleasure,</span>
					<span>Weighed his worth, and his warlike achievements</span>
					<span>Mightily commended, as ’tis meet one praise his</span>
					<span>Liegelord in words and love him in spirit,</span>
					<span>When forth from his body he fares to destruction.</span>
					<span>So lamented mourning the men of the Geats,</span>
					<span>Fond-loving vassals, the fall of their lord,</span>
					<span>Said he was kindest of kings under heaven,</span>
					<span>Gentlest of men, most winning of manner,</span>
					<span>Friendliest to folk-troops and fondest of honor.</span>
