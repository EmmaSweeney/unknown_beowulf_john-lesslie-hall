<h2>
<span>XXVIII.</span>
<span>THE HOMEWARD JOURNEY.—THE TWO QUEENS.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>Then the band of very valiant retainers</span>
<span>Came to the current; they were clad all in armor,</span>
<span>In link-woven burnies. The land-warder noticed</span>
<span>The return of the earlmen, as he erstwhile had seen them;</span>
<span>Nowise with insult he greeted the strangers</span>
<span>From the naze of the cliff, but rode on to meet them;</span>
<span>Said the bright-armored visitors vesselward traveled</span>
<span>Welcome to Weders. The wide-bosomed craft then</span>
<span>Lay on the sand, laden with armor,</span>
<span>With horses and jewels, the ring-stemmèd sailer:</span>
<span>The mast uptowered o’er the treasure of Hrothgar.</span>
<span>To the boat-ward a gold-bound brand he presented,</span>
<span>That he was afterwards honored on the ale-bench more highly</span>
<span>As the heirloom’s owner. Set he out on his vessel,</span>
<span>To drive on the deep, Dane-country left he.</span>
<span>Along by the mast then a sea-garment fluttered,</span>
<span>A rope-fastened sail. The sea-boat resounded,</span>
<span>The wind o’er the waters the wave-floater nowise</span>
<span>Kept from its journey; the sea-goer traveled,</span>
<span>The foamy-necked floated forth o’er the currents,</span>
<span>The well-fashioned vessel o’er the ways of the ocean,</span>
<span>Till they came within sight of the cliffs of the Geatmen,</span>
<span>The well-known headlands. The wave-goer hastened</span>
<span>Driven by breezes, stood on the shore.</span>
<span>Prompt at the ocean, the port-ward was ready,</span>
<span>Who long in the past outlooked in the distance,</span>
<span>At water’s-edge waiting well-lovèd heroes;</span>
<span>He bound to the bank then the broad-bosomed vessel</span>
<span>Fast in its fetters, lest the force of the waters</span>
<span>Should be able to injure the ocean-wood winsome.</span>
<span>Bade he up then take the treasure of princes,</span>
<span>Plate-gold and fretwork; not far was it thence</span>
<span>To go off in search of the giver of jewels:</span>
<span>Hrethel’s son Higelac at home there remaineth,</span>
<span>Himself with his comrades close to the sea-coast.</span>
<span>The building was splendid, the king heroic,</span>
<span>Great in his hall, Hygd very young was,</span>
<span>Fine-mooded, clever, though few were the winters</span>
<span>That the daughter of Hæreth had dwelt in the borough;</span>
<span>But she nowise was cringing nor niggard of presents,</span>
<span>Of ornaments rare, to the race of the Geatmen.</span>
<span>Thrytho nursed anger, excellent folk-queen,</span>
<span>Hot-burning hatred: no hero whatever</span>
<span>’Mong household companions, her husband excepted</span>
<span>Dared to adventure to look at the woman</span>
<span>With eyes in the daytime; but he knew that death-chains</span>
<span>Hand-wreathed were wrought him: early thereafter,</span>
<span>When the hand-strife was over, edges were ready,</span>
<span>That fierce-raging sword-point had to force a decision,</span>
<span>Murder-bale show. Such no womanly custom</span>
<span>For a lady to practise, though lovely her person,</span>
<span>That a weaver-of-peace, on pretence of anger</span>
<span>A belovèd liegeman of life should deprive.</span>
<span>Soothly this hindered Heming’s kinsman;</span>
<span>Other ale-drinking earlmen asserted</span>
<span>That fearful folk-sorrows fewer she wrought them,</span>
<span>Treacherous doings, since first she was given</span>
<span>Adorned with gold to the war-hero youthful,</span>
<span>For her origin honored, when Offa’s great palace</span>
<span>O’er the fallow flood by her father’s instructions</span>
<span>She sought on her journey, where she afterwards fully,</span>
<span>Famed for her virtue, her fate on the king’s-seat</span>
<span>Enjoyed in her lifetime, love did she hold with</span>
<span>The ruler of heroes, the best, it is told me,</span>
<span>Of all of the earthmen that oceans encompass,</span>
<span>Of earl-kindreds endless; hence Offa was famous</span>
<span>Far and widely, by gifts and by battles,</span>
<span>Spear-valiant hero; the home of his fathers</span>
<span>He governed with wisdom, whence Eomær did issue</span>
<span>For help unto heroes, Heming’s kinsman,</span>
<span>Grandson of Garmund, great in encounters.</span>
