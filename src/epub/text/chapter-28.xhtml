<h2>
<span>XXVIII.</span>
<span>THE HOMEWARD JOURNEY.—THE TWO QUEENS.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.1">Then the band of very valiant retainers</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.2">Came to the current; they were clad all in armor,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.3">In link-woven burnies. The land-warder noticed</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.4">The return of the earlmen, as he erstwhile had seen them;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.5">Nowise with insult he greeted the strangers</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.6">From the naze of the cliff, but rode on to meet them;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.7">Said the bright-armored visitors vesselward traveled</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.8">Welcome to Weders. The wide-bosomed craft then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.9">Lay on the sand, laden with armor,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.10">With horses and jewels, the ring-stemmèd sailer:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.11">The mast uptowered o’er the treasure of Hrothgar.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.12">To the boat-ward a gold-bound brand he presented,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.13">That he was afterwards honored on the ale-bench more highly</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.14">As the heirloom’s owner. Set he out on his vessel,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.15">To drive on the deep, Dane-country left he.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.16">Along by the mast then a sea-garment fluttered,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.17">A rope-fastened sail. The sea-boat resounded,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.18">The wind o’er the waters the wave-floater nowise</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.19">Kept from its journey; the sea-goer traveled,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.20">The foamy-necked floated forth o’er the currents,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.21">The well-fashioned vessel o’er the ways of the ocean,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.22">Till they came within sight of the cliffs of the Geatmen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.23">The well-known headlands. The wave-goer hastened</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.24">Driven by breezes, stood on the shore.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.25">Prompt at the ocean, the port-ward was ready,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.26">Who long in the past outlooked in the distance,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.27">At water’s-edge waiting well-lovèd heroes;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.28">He bound to the bank then the broad-bosomed vessel</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.29">Fast in its fetters, lest the force of the waters</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.30">Should be able to injure the ocean-wood winsome.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.31">Bade he up then take the treasure of princes,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.32">Plate-gold and fretwork; not far was it thence</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.33">To go off in search of the giver of jewels:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.34">Hrethel’s son Higelac at home there remaineth,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.35">Himself with his comrades close to the sea-coast.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.36">The building was splendid, the king heroic,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.37">Great in his hall, Hygd very young was,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.38">Fine-mooded, clever, though few were the winters</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.39">That the daughter of Hæreth had dwelt in the borough;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.40">But she nowise was cringing nor niggard of presents,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.41">Of ornaments rare, to the race of the Geatmen.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.42">Thrytho nursed anger, excellent folk-queen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.43">Hot-burning hatred: no hero whatever</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.44">’Mong household companions, her husband excepted</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.45">Dared to adventure to look at the woman</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.46">With eyes in the daytime; but he knew that death-chains</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.47">Hand-wreathed were wrought him: early thereafter,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.48">When the hand-strife was over, edges were ready,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.49">That fierce-raging sword-point had to force a decision,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.50">Murder-bale show. Such no womanly custom</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.51">For a lady to practise, though lovely her person,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.52">That a weaver-of-peace, on pretence of anger</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.53">A belovèd liegeman of life should deprive.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.54">Soothly this hindered Heming’s kinsman;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.55">Other ale-drinking earlmen asserted</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.56">That fearful folk-sorrows fewer she wrought them,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.57">Treacherous doings, since first she was given</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.58">Adorned with gold to the war-hero youthful,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.59">For her origin honored, when Offa’s great palace</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.60">O’er the fallow flood by her father’s instructions</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.61">She sought on her journey, where she afterwards fully,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.62">Famed for her virtue, her fate on the king’s-seat</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.63">Enjoyed in her lifetime, love did she hold with</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.64">The ruler of heroes, the best, it is told me,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.65">Of all of the earthmen that oceans encompass,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.66">Of earl-kindreds endless; hence Offa was famous</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.67">Far and widely, by gifts and by battles,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.68">Spear-valiant hero; the home of his fathers</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.69">He governed with wisdom, whence Eomær did issue</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.70">For help unto heroes, Heming’s kinsman,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVIII.71">Grandson of Garmund, great in encounters.</div>
