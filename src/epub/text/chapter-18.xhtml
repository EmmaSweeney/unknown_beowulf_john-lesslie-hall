<span>XVIII.</span>
<span>THE FINN EPISODE (<i>continued</i>).—THE BANQUET CONTINUES.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.1">“Then the warriors departed to go to their dwellings,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.2">Reaved of their friends, Friesland to visit,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.3">Their homes and high-city. Hengest continued</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.4">Biding with Finn the blood-tainted winter,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.5">Wholly unsundered; of fatherland thought he</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.6">Though unable to drive the ring-stemmèd vessel</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.7">O’er the ways of the waters; the wave-deeps were tossing,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.8">Fought with the wind; winter in ice-bonds</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.9">Closed up the currents, till there came to the dwelling</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.10">A year in its course, as yet it revolveth,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.11">If season propitious one alway regardeth,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.12">World-cheering weathers. Then winter was gone,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.13">Earth’s bosom was lovely; the exile would get him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.14">The guest from the palace; on grewsomest vengeance</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.15">He brooded more eager than on oversea journeys,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.16">Whe’r onset-of-anger he were able to ’complish,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.17">The bairns of the Jutemen therein to remember.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.18">Nowise refused he the duties of liegeman</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.19">When Hun of the Frisians the battle-sword Láfing,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.20">Fairest of falchions, friendly did give him:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.21">Its edges were famous in folk-talk of Jutland.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.22">And savage sword-fury seized in its clutches</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.23">Bold-mooded Finn where he bode in his palace,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.24">When the grewsome grapple Guthlaf and Oslaf</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.25">Had mournfully mentioned, the mere-journey over,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.26">For sorrows half-blamed him; the flickering spirit</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.27">Could not bide in his bosom. Then the building was covered</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.28">With corpses of foemen, and Finn too was slaughtered,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.29">The king with his comrades, and the queen made a prisoner.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.30">The troops of the Scyldings bore to their vessels</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.31">All that the land-king had in his palace,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.32">Such trinkets and treasures they took as, on searching,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.33">At Finn’s they could find. They ferried to Daneland</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.34">The excellent woman on oversea journey,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.35">Led her to their land-folk.” The lay was concluded,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.36">The gleeman’s recital. Shouts again rose then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.37">Bench-glee resounded, bearers then offered</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.38">Wine from wonder-vats. Wealhtheo advanced then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.39">Going ’neath gold-crown, where the good ones were seated</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.40">Uncle and nephew; their peace was yet mutual,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.41">True each to the other. And Unferth the spokesman</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.42">Sat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.43">Each trusted his spirit that his mood was courageous,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.44">Though at fight he had failed in faith to his kinsmen.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.45">Said the queen of the Scyldings: “My lord and protector,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.46">Treasure-bestower, take thou this beaker;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.47">Joyance attend thee, gold-friend of heroes,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.48">And greet thou the Geatmen with gracious responses!</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.49">So ought one to do. Be kind to the Geatmen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.50">In gifts not niggardly; anear and afar now</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.51">Peace thou enjoyest. Report hath informed me</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.52">Thou’lt have for a bairn the battle-brave hero.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.53">Now is Heorot cleansèd, ring-palace gleaming;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.54">Give while thou mayest many rewards,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.55">And bequeath to thy kinsmen kingdom and people,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.56">On wending thy way to the Wielder’s splendor.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.57">I know good Hrothulf, that the noble young troopers</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.58">He’ll care for and honor, lord of the Scyldings,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.59">If earth-joys thou endest earlier than he doth;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.60">I reckon that recompense he’ll render with kindness</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.61">Our offspring and issue, if that all he remember,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.62">What favors of yore, when he yet was an infant,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.63">We awarded to him for his worship and pleasure.”</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.64">Then she turned by the bench where her sons were carousing,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.65">Hrethric and Hrothmund, and the heroes’ offspring,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.66">The war-youth together; there the good one was sitting</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XVIII.67">’Twixt the brothers twain, Beowulf Geatman.</div>
