<h2>
<span>I</span>
<span>THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SCYLD.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>Lo! the Spear-Danes’ glory through splendid achievements</span>
<span>The folk-kings’ former fame we have heard of,</span>
<span>How princes displayed then their prowess-in-battle.</span>
<span>Oft Scyld the Scefing from scathers in numbers</span>
<span>From many a people their mead-benches tore.</span>
<span>Since first he found him friendless and wretched,</span>
<span>The earl had had terror: comfort he got for it,</span>
<span>Waxed ’neath the welkin, world-honor gained,</span>
<span>Till all his neighbors o’er sea were compelled to</span>
<span>Bow to his bidding and bring him their tribute:</span>
<span>An excellent atheling! After was borne him</span>
<span>A son and heir, young in his dwelling,</span>
<span>Whom God-Father sent to solace the people.</span>
<span>He had marked the misery malice had caused them,</span>
<span>That reaved of their rulers they wretched had erstwhile</span>
<span>Long been afflicted. The Lord, in requital,</span>
<span>Wielder of Glory, with world-honor blessed him.</span>
<span>Famed was Beowulf, far spread the glory</span>
<span>Of Scyld’s great son in the lands of the Danemen.</span>
<span>So the carle that is young, by kindnesses rendered</span>
<span>The friends of his father, with fees in abundance</span>
<span>Must be able to earn that when age approacheth</span>
<span>Eager companions aid him requitingly,</span>
<span>When war assaults him serve him as liegemen:</span>
<span>By praise-worthy actions must honor be got</span>
<span>’Mong all of the races. At the hour that was fated</span>
<span>Scyld then departed to the All-Father’s keeping</span>
<span>Warlike to wend him; away then they bare him</span>
<span>To the flood of the current, his fond-loving comrades,</span>
<span>As himself he had bidden, while the friend of the Scyldings</span>
<span>Word-sway wielded, and the well-lovèd land-prince</span>
<span>Long did rule them. The ring-stemmèd vessel,</span>
<span>Bark of the atheling, lay there at anchor,</span>
<span>Icy in glimmer and eager for sailing;</span>
<span>The belovèd leader laid they down there,</span>
<span>Giver of rings, on the breast of the vessel,</span>
<span>The famed by the mainmast. A many of jewels,</span>
<span>Of fretted embossings, from far-lands brought over,</span>
<span>Was placed near at hand then; and heard I not ever</span>
<span>That a folk ever furnished a float more superbly</span>
<span>With weapons of warfare, weeds for the battle,</span>
<span>Bills and burnies; on his bosom sparkled</span>
<span>Many a jewel that with him must travel</span>
<span>On the flush of the flood afar on the current.</span>
<span>And favors no fewer they furnished him soothly,</span>
<span>Excellent folk-gems, than others had given him</span>
<span>Who when first he was born outward did send him</span>
<span>Lone on the main, the merest of infants:</span>
<span>And a gold-fashioned standard they stretched under heaven</span>
<span>High o’er his head, let the holm-currents bear him,</span>
<span>Seaward consigned him: sad was their spirit,</span>
<span>Their mood very mournful. Men are not able</span>
<span>Soothly to tell us, they in halls who reside,</span>
<span>Heroes under heaven, to what haven he hied.</span>
