				<p>					<span>“He seeks then his chamber, singeth a woe-song</span>
					<span>One for the other; all too extensive</span>
					<span>Seemed homesteads and plains. So the helm of the Weders</span>
					<span>Mindful of Herebald heart-sorrow carried,</span>
					<span>Stirred with emotion, nowise was able</span>
					<span>To wreak his ruin on the ruthless destroyer:</span>
					<span>He was unable to follow the warrior with hatred,</span>
					<span>With deeds that were direful, though dear he not held him.</span>
					<span>Then pressed by the pang this pain occasioned him,</span>
					<span>He gave up glee, God-light elected;</span>
					<span>He left to his sons, as the man that is rich does,</span>
					<span>His land and fortress, when from life he departed.</span>
					<span>Then was crime and hostility ’twixt Swedes and Geatmen,</span>
					<span>O’er wide-stretching water warring was mutual,</span>
					<span>Burdensome hatred, when Hrethel had perished,</span>
					<span>And Ongentheow’s offspring were active and valiant,</span>
					<span>Wished not to hold to peace oversea, but</span>
					<span>Round Hreosna-beorh often accomplished</span>
					<span>Cruelest massacre. This my kinsman avengèd,</span>
					<span>The feud and fury, as ’tis found on inquiry,</span>
					<span>Though one of them paid it with forfeit of life-joys,</span>
					<span>With price that was hard: the struggle became then</span>
					<span>Fatal to Hæthcyn, lord of the Geatmen.</span>
					<span>Then I heard that at morning one brother the other</span>
					<span>With edges of irons egged on to murder,</span>
					<span>Where Ongentheow maketh onset on Eofor:</span>
					<span>The helmet crashed, the hoary-haired Scylfing</span>
					<span>Sword-smitten fell, his hand then remembered</span>
					<span>Feud-hate sufficient, refused not the death-blow.</span>
					<span>The gems that he gave me, with jewel-bright sword I</span>
					<span>’Quited in contest, as occasion was offered:</span>
					<span>Land he allowed me, life-joy at homestead,</span>
					<span>Manor to live on. Little he needed</span>
					<span>From Gepids or Danes or in Sweden to look for</span>
					<span>Trooper less true, with treasure to buy him;</span>
					<span>’Mong foot-soldiers ever in front I would hie me,</span>
					<span>Alone in the vanguard, and evermore gladly</span>
					<span>Warfare shall wage, while this weapon endureth</span>
					<span>That late and early often did serve me</span>
					<span>When I proved before heroes the slayer of Dæghrefn,</span>
					<span>Knight of the Hugmen: he by no means was suffered</span>
					<span>To the king of the Frisians to carry the jewels,</span>
					<span>The breast-decoration; but the banner-possessor</span>
					<span>Bowed in the battle, brave-mooded atheling.</span>
					<span>No weapon was slayer, but war-grapple broke then</span>
					<span>The surge of his spirit, his body destroying.</span>
					<span>Now shall weapon’s edge make war for the treasure,</span>
					<span>And hand and firm-sword.” Beowulf spake then,</span>
					<span>Boast-words uttered⁠—the latest occasion:</span>
					<span>“I braved in my youth-days battles unnumbered;</span>
					<span>Still am I willing the struggle to look for,</span>
					<span>Fame-deeds perform, folk-warden prudent,</span>
					<span>If the hateful despoiler forth from his cavern</span>
					<span>Seeketh me out!” Each of the heroes,</span>
					<span>Helm-bearers sturdy, he thereupon greeted</span>
					<span>Belovèd co-liegemen⁠—his last salutation:</span>
					<span>“No brand would I bear, no blade for the dragon,</span>
					<span>Wist I a way my word-boast to ’complish</span>
					<span>Else with the monster, as with Grendel I did it;</span>
					<span>But fire in the battle hot I expect there,</span>
					<span>Furious flame-burning: so I fixed on my body</span>
					<span>Target and war-mail. The ward of the barrow</span>
					<span>I’ll not flee from a foot-length, the foeman uncanny.</span>
					<span>At the wall ’twill befall us as Fate decreeth,</span>
					<span>Each one’s Creator. I am eager in spirit,</span>
					<span>With the wingèd war-hero to away with all boasting.</span>
					<span>Bide on the barrow with burnies protected,</span>
					<span>Earls in armor, which of <i>us</i> two may better</span>
					<span>Bear his disaster, when the battle is over.</span>
					<span>’Tis no matter of yours, and man cannot do it,</span>
					<span>But me and me only, to measure his strength with</span>
					<span>The monster of malice, might-deeds to ’complish.</span>
					<span>I with prowess shall gain the gold, or the battle,</span>
					<span>Direful death-woe will drag off your ruler!”</span>
					<span>The mighty champion rose by his shield then,</span>
					<span>Brave under helmet, in battle-mail went he</span>
					<span>’Neath steep-rising stone-cliffs, the strength he relied on</span>
					<span>Of one man alone: no work for a coward.</span>
					<span>Then he saw by the wall who a great many battles</span>
					<span>Had lived through, most worthy, when foot-troops collided,</span>
					<span>Stone-arches standing, stout-hearted champion,</span>
					<span>Saw a brook from the barrow bubbling out thenceward:</span>
					<span>The flood of the fountain was fuming with war-flame:</span>
					<span>Not nigh to the hoard, for season the briefest</span>
					<span>Could he brave, without burning, the abyss that was yawning,</span>
					<span>The drake was so fiery. The prince of the Weders</span>
					<span>Caused then that words came from his bosom,</span>
					<span>So fierce was his fury; the firm-hearted shouted:</span>
					<span>His battle-clear voice came in resounding</span>
					<span>’Neath the gray-colored stone. Stirred was his hatred,</span>
					<span>The hoard-ward distinguished the speech of a man;</span>
					<span>Time was no longer to look out for friendship.</span>
					<span>The breath of the monster issued forth first,</span>
					<span>Vapory war-sweat, out of the stone-cave:</span>
					<span>The earth re-echoed. The earl ’neath the barrow</span>
					<span>Lifted his shield, lord of the Geatmen,</span>
					<span>Tow’rd the terrible stranger: the ring-twisted creature’s</span>
					<span>Heart was then ready to seek for a struggle.</span>
					<span>The excellent battle-king first brandished his weapon,</span>
					<span>The ancient heirloom, of edges unblunted,</span>
					<span>To the death-planners twain was terror from other.</span>
					<span>The lord of the troopers intrepidly stood then</span>
					<span>’Gainst his high-rising shield, when the dragon coiled him</span>
					<span>Quickly together: in corslet he bided.</span>
					<span>He went then in blazes, bended and striding,</span>
					<span>Hasting him forward. His life and body</span>
					<span>The targe well protected, for time-period shorter</span>
					<span>Than wish demanded for the well-renowned leader,</span>
					<span>Where he then for the first day was forced to be victor,</span>
					<span>Famous in battle, as Fate had not willed it.</span>
					<span>The lord of the Geatmen uplifted his hand then,</span>
					<span>Smiting the fire-drake with sword that was precious,</span>
					<span>That bright on the bone the blade-edge did weaken,</span>
					<span>Bit more feebly than his folk-leader needed,</span>
					<span>Burdened with bale-griefs. Then the barrow-protector,</span>
					<span>When the sword-blow had fallen, was fierce in his spirit,</span>
					<span>Flinging his fires, flamings of battle</span>
					<span>Gleamed then afar: the gold-friend of Weders</span>
					<span>Boasted no conquests, his battle-sword failed him</span>
					<span>Naked in conflict, as by no means it ought to,</span>
					<span>Long-trusty weapon. ’Twas no slight undertaking</span>
					<span>That Ecgtheow’s famous offspring would leave</span>
					<span>The drake-cavern’s bottom; he must live in some region</span>
					<span>Other than this, by the will of the dragon,</span>
					<span>As each one of earthmen existence must forfeit.</span>
					<span>’Twas early thereafter the excellent warriors</span>
					<span>Met with each other. Anew and afresh</span>
					<span>The hoard-ward took heart (gasps heaved then his bosom):</span>
					<span>Sorrow he suffered encircled with fire</span>
					<span>Who the people erst governed. His companions by no means</span>
					<span>Were banded about him, bairns of the princes,</span>
					<span>With valorous spirit, but they sped to the forest,</span>
					<span>Seeking for safety. The soul-deeps of one were</span>
					<span>Ruffled by care: kin-love can never</span>
					<span>Aught in him waver who well doth consider.</span>
