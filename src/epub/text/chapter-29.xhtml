<h2>
<span>XXIX.</span>
<span>BEOWULF AND HIGELAC.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.1">Then the brave one departed, his band along with him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.2">Seeking the sea-shore, the sea-marches treading,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.3">The wide-stretching shores. The world-candle glimmered,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.4">The sun from the southward; they proceeded then onward,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.5">Early arriving where they heard that the troop-lord,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.6">Ongentheow’s slayer, excellent, youthful</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.7">Folk-prince and warrior was distributing jewels,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.8">Close in his castle. The coming of Beowulf</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.9">Was announced in a message quickly to Higelac,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.10">That the folk-troop’s defender forth to the palace</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.11">The linden-companion alive was advancing,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.12">Secure from the combat courtward a-going.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.13">The building was early inward made ready</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.14">For the foot-going guests as the good one had ordered.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.15">He sat by the man then who had lived through the struggle,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.16">Kinsman by kinsman, when the king of the people</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.17">Had in lordly language saluted the dear one,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.18">In words that were formal. The daughter of Hæreth</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.19">Coursed through the building, carrying mead-cups:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.20">She loved the retainers, tendered the beakers</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.21">To the high-minded Geatmen. Higelac ’gan then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.22">Pleasantly plying his companion with questions</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.23">In the high-towering palace. A curious interest</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.24">Tormented his spirit, what meaning to see in</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.25">The Sea-Geats’ adventures: “Beowulf worthy,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.26">How throve your journeying, when thou thoughtest suddenly</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.27">Far o’er the salt-streams to seek an encounter,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.28">A battle at Heorot? Hast bettered for Hrothgar,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.29">The famous folk-leader, his far-published sorrows</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.30">Any at all? In agony-billows</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.31">I mused upon torture, distrusted the journey</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.32">Of the belovèd liegeman; I long time did pray thee</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.33">By no means to seek out the murderous spirit,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.34">To suffer the South-Danes themselves to decide on</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.35">Grappling with Grendel. To God I am thankful</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.36">To be suffered to see thee safe from thy journey.”</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.37">Beowulf answered, bairn of old Ecgtheow:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.38">“’Tis hidden by no means, Higelac chieftain,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.39">From many of men, the meeting so famous,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.40">What mournful moments of me and of Grendel</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.41">Were passed in the place where he pressing affliction</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.42">On the Victory-Scyldings scathefully brought,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.43">Anguish forever; that all I avengèd,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.44">So that any under heaven of the kinsmen of Grendel</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.45">Needeth not boast of that cry-in-the-morning,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.46">Who longest liveth of the loth-going kindred,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.47">Encompassed by moorland. I came in my journey</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.48">To the royal ring-hall, Hrothgar to greet there:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.49">Soon did the famous scion of Healfdene,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.50">When he understood fully the spirit that led me,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.51">Assign me a seat with the son of his bosom.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.52">The troop was in joyance; mead-glee greater</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.53">’Neath arch of the ether not ever beheld I</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.54">’Mid hall-building holders. The highly-famed queen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.55">Peace-tie of peoples, oft passed through the building,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.56">Cheered the young troopers; she oft tendered a hero</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.57">A beautiful ring-band, ere she went to her sitting.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.58">Oft the daughter of Hrothgar in view of the courtiers</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.59">To the earls at the end the ale-vessel carried,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.60">Whom Freaware I heard then hall-sitters title,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.61">When nail-adorned jewels she gave to the heroes:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.62">Gold-bedecked, youthful, to the glad son of Froda</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.63">Her faith has been plighted; the friend of the Scyldings,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.64">The guard of the kingdom, hath given his sanction,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.65">And counts it a vantage, for a part of the quarrels,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.66">A portion of hatred, to pay with the woman.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.67">Somewhere not rarely, when the ruler has fallen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.68">The life-taking lance relaxeth its fury</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIX.69">For a brief breathing-spell, though the bride be charming!</div>
