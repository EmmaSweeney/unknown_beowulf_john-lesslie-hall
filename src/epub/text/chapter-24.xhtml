<h2>
<span>XXIV.</span>
<span>BEOWULF IS DOUBLE-CONQUEROR.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.1">Then he saw mid the war-gems a weapon of victory,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.2">An ancient giant-sword, of edges a-doughty,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.3">Glory of warriors: of weapons ’twas choicest,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.4">Only ’twas larger than any man else was</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.5">Able to bear to the battle-encounter,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.6">The good and splendid work of the giants.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.7">He grasped then the sword-hilt, knight of the Scyldings,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.8">Bold and battle-grim, brandished his ring-sword,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.9">Hopeless of living, hotly he smote her,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.10">That the fiend-woman’s neck firmly it grappled,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.11">Broke through her bone-joints, the bill fully pierced her</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.12">Fate-cursèd body, she fell to the ground then:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.13">The hand-sword was bloody, the hero exulted.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.14">The brand was brilliant, brightly it glimmered,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.15">Just as from heaven gemlike shineth</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.16">The torch of the firmament. He glanced ’long the building,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.17">And turned by the wall then, Higelac’s vassal</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.18">Raging and wrathful raised his battle-sword</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.19">Strong by the handle. The edge was not useless</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.20">To the hero-in-battle, but he speedily wished to</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.21">Give Grendel requital for the many assaults he</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.22">Had worked on the West-Danes not once, but often,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.23">When he slew in slumber the subjects of Hrothgar,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.24">Swallowed down fifteen sleeping retainers</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.25">Of the folk of the Danemen, and fully as many</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.26">Carried away, a horrible prey.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.27">He gave him requital, grim-raging champion,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.28">When he saw on his rest-place weary of conflict</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.29">Grendel lying, of life-joys bereavèd,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.30">As the battle at Heorot erstwhile had scathed him;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.31">His body far bounded, a blow when he suffered,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.32">Death having seized him, sword-smiting heavy,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.33">And he cut off his head then. Early this noticed</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.34">The clever carles who as comrades of Hrothgar</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.35">Gazed on the sea-deeps, that the surging wave-currents</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.36">Were mightily mingled, the mere-flood was gory:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.37">Of the good one the gray-haired together held converse,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.38">The hoary of head, that they hoped not to see again</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.39">The atheling ever, that exulting in victory</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.40">He’d return there to visit the distinguished folk-ruler:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.41">Then many concluded the mere-wolf had killed him.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.42">The ninth hour came then. From the ness-edge departed</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.43">The bold-mooded Scyldings; the gold-friend of heroes</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.44">Homeward betook him. The strangers sat down then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.45">Soul-sick, sorrowful, the sea-waves regarding:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.46">They wished and yet weened not their well-loved friend-lord</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.47">To see any more. The sword-blade began then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.48">The blood having touched it, contracting and shriveling</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.49">With battle-icicles; ’twas a wonderful marvel</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.50">That it melted entirely, likest to ice when</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.51">The Father unbindeth the bond of the frost and</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.52">Unwindeth the wave-bands, He who wieldeth dominion</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.53">Of times and of tides: a truth-firm Creator.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.54">Nor took he of jewels more in the dwelling,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.55">Lord of the Weders, though they lay all around him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.56">Than the head and the handle handsome with jewels;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.57">The brand early melted, burnt was the weapon:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.58">So hot was the blood, the strange-spirit poisonous</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.59">That in it did perish. He early swam off then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.60">Who had bided in combat the carnage of haters,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.61">Went up through the ocean; the eddies were cleansèd,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.62">The spacious expanses, when the spirit from farland</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.63">His life put aside and this short-lived existence.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.64">The seamen’s defender came swimming to land then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.65">Doughty of spirit, rejoiced in his sea-gift,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.66">The bulky burden which he bore in his keeping.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.67">The excellent vassals advanced then to meet him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.68">To God they were grateful, were glad in their chieftain,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.69">That to see him safe and sound was granted them.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.70">From the high-minded hero, then, helmet and burnie</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.71">Were speedily loosened: the ocean was putrid,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.72">The water ’neath welkin weltered with gore.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.73">Forth did they fare, then, their footsteps retracing,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.74">Merry and mirthful, measured the earth-way,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.75">The highway familiar: men very daring</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.76">Bare then the head from the sea-cliff, burdening</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.77">Each of the earlmen, excellent-valiant.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.78">Four of them had to carry with labor</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.79">The head of Grendel to the high towering gold-hall</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.80">Upstuck on the spear, till fourteen most-valiant</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.81">And battle-brave Geatmen came there going</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.82">Straight to the palace: the prince of the people</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.83">Measured the mead-ways, their mood-brave companion.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.84">The atheling of earlmen entered the building,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.85">Deed-valiant man, adorned with distinction,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.86">Doughty shield-warrior, to address King Hrothgar:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.87">Then hung by the hair, the head of Grendel</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.88">Was borne to the building, where beer-thanes were drinking,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.89">Loth before earlmen and eke ’fore the lady:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXIV.90">The warriors beheld then a wonderful sight.</div>
