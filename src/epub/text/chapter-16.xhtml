				<p>					<span>Then straight was ordered that Heorot inside</span>
					<span>With hands be embellished: a host of them gathered,</span>
					<span>Of men and women, who the wassailing-building</span>
					<span>The guest-hall begeared. Gold-flashing sparkled</span>
					<span>Webs on the walls then, of wonders a many</span>
					<span>To each of the heroes that look on such objects.</span>
					<span>The beautiful building was broken to pieces</span>
					<span>Which all within with irons was fastened,</span>
					<span>Its hinges torn off: only the roof was</span>
					<span>Whole and uninjured when the horrible creature</span>
					<span>Outlawed for evil off had betaken him,</span>
					<span>Hopeless of living. ’Tis hard to avoid it</span>
					<span>(Whoever will do it!); but he doubtless must come to</span>
					<span>The place awaiting, as Wyrd hath appointed,</span>
					<span>Soul-bearers, earth-dwellers, earls under heaven,</span>
					<span>Where bound on its bed his body shall slumber</span>
					<span>When feasting is finished. Full was the time then</span>
					<span>That the son of Healfdene went to the building;</span>
					<span>The excellent atheling would eat of the banquet.</span>
					<span>Ne’er heard I that people with hero-band larger</span>
					<span>Bare them better tow’rds their bracelet-bestower.</span>
					<span>The laden-with-glory stooped to the bench then</span>
					<span>(Their kinsmen-companions in plenty were joyful,</span>
					<span>Many a cupful quaffing complaisantly),</span>
					<span>Doughty of spirit in the high-tow’ring palace,</span>
					<span>Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot then inside</span>
					<span>Was filled with friendly ones; falsehood and treachery</span>
					<span>The Folk-Scyldings now nowise did practise.</span>
					<span>Then the offspring of Healfdene offered to Beowulf</span>
					<span>A golden standard, as reward for the victory,</span>
					<span>A banner embossed, burnie and helmet;</span>
					<span>Many men saw then a song-famous weapon</span>
					<span>Borne ’fore the hero. Beowulf drank of</span>
					<span>The cup in the building; that treasure-bestowing</span>
					<span>He needed not blush for in battle-men’s presence.</span>
					<span>Ne’er heard I that many men on the ale-bench</span>
					<span>In friendlier fashion to their fellows presented</span>
					<span>Four bright jewels with gold-work embellished.</span>
					<span>’Round the roof of the helmet a head-guarder outside</span>
					<span>Braided with wires, with bosses was furnished,</span>
					<span>That swords-for-the-battle fight-hardened might fail</span>
					<span>Boldly to harm him, when the hero proceeded</span>
					<span>Forth against foemen. The defender of earls then</span>
					<span>Commanded that eight steeds with bridles</span>
					<span>Gold-plated, gleaming, be guided to hallward,</span>
					<span>Inside the building; on one of them stood then</span>
					<span>An art-broidered saddle embellished with jewels;</span>
					<span>’Twas the sovereign’s seat, when the son of King Healfdene</span>
					<span>Was pleased to take part in the play of the edges;</span>
					<span>The famous one’s valor ne’er failed at the front when</span>
					<span>Slain ones were bowing. And to Beowulf granted</span>
					<span>The prince of the Ingwins, power over both,</span>
					<span>O’er war-steeds and weapons; bade him well to enjoy them.</span>
					<span>In so manly a manner the mighty-famed chieftain,</span>
					<span>Hoard-ward of heroes, with horses and jewels</span>
					<span>War-storms requited, that none e’er condemneth</span>
					<span>Who willeth to tell truth with full justice.</span>
