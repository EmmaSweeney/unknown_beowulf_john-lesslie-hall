<h2>
<span>XXVI.</span>
<span>HROTHGAR MORALIZES.—REST AFTER LABOR.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.1">“Then bruised in his bosom he with bitter-toothed missile</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.2">Is hurt ’neath his helmet: from harmful pollution</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.3">He is powerless to shield him by the wonderful mandates</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.4">Of the loath-cursèd spirit; what too long he hath holden</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.5">Him seemeth too small, savage he hoardeth,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.6">Nor boastfully giveth gold-plated rings,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.7">The fate of the future flouts and forgetteth</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.8">Since God had erst given him greatness no little,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.9">Wielder of Glory. His end-day anear,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.10">It afterward happens that the bodily-dwelling</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.11">Fleetingly fadeth, falls into ruins;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.12">Another lays hold who doleth the ornaments,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.13">The nobleman’s jewels, nothing lamenting,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.14">Heedeth no terror. Oh, Beowulf dear,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.15">Best of the heroes, from bale-strife defend thee,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.16">And choose thee the better, counsels eternal;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.17">Beware of arrogance, world-famous champion!</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.18">But a little-while lasts thy life-vigor’s fulness;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.19">’Twill after hap early, that illness or sword-edge</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.20">Shall part thee from strength, or the grasp of the fire,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.21">Or the wave of the current, or clutch of the edges,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.22">Or flight of the war-spear, or age with its horrors,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.23">Or thine eyes’ bright flashing shall fade into darkness:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.24">’Twill happen full early, excellent hero,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.25">That death shall subdue thee. So the Danes a half-century</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.26">I held under heaven, helped them in struggles</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.27">’Gainst many a race in middle-earth’s regions,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.28">With ash-wood and edges, that enemies none</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.29">On earth molested me. Lo! offsetting change, now,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.30">Came to my manor, grief after joyance,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.31">When Grendel became my constant visitor,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.32">Inveterate hater: I from that malice</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.33">Continually travailed with trouble no little.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.34">Thanks be to God that I gained in my lifetime,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.35">To the Lord everlasting, to look on the gory</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.36">Head with mine eyes, after long-lasting sorrow!</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.37">Go to the bench now, battle-adornèd</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.38">Joy in the feasting: of jewels in common</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.39">We’ll meet with many when morning appeareth.”</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.40">The Geatman was gladsome, ganged he immediately</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.41">To go to the bench, as the clever one bade him.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.42">Then again as before were the famous-for-prowess,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.43">Hall-inhabiters, handsomely banqueted,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.44">Feasted anew. The night-veil fell then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.45">Dark o’er the warriors. The courtiers rose then;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.46">The gray-haired was anxious to go to his slumbers,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.47">The hoary old Scylding. Hankered the Geatman,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.48">The champion doughty, greatly, to rest him:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.49">An earlman early outward did lead him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.50">Fagged from his faring, from far-country springing,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.51">Who for etiquette’s sake all of a liegeman’s</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.52">Needs regarded, such as seamen at that time</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.53">Were bounden to feel. The big-hearted rested;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.54">The building uptowered, spacious and gilded,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.55">The guest within slumbered, till the sable-clad raven</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.56">Blithely foreboded the beacon of heaven.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.57">Then the bright-shining sun o’er the bottoms came going;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.58">The warriors hastened, the heads of the peoples</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.59">Were ready to go again to their peoples,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.60">The high-mooded farer would faraway thenceward</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.61">Look for his vessel. The valiant one bade then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.62">Offspring of Ecglaf, off to bear Hrunting,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.63">To take his weapon, his well-beloved iron;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.64">He him thanked for the gift, saying good he accounted</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.65">The war-friend and mighty, nor chid he with words then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.66">The blade of the brand: ’twas a brave-mooded hero.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.67">When the warriors were ready, arrayed in their trappings,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.68">The atheling dear to the Danemen advanced then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.69">On to the dais, where the other was sitting,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVI.70">Grim-mooded hero, greeted King Hrothgar.</div>
