<h2>
<span>XX.</span>
<span>THE MOTHER OF GRENDEL.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.1">They sank then to slumber. With sorrow one paid for</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.2">His evening repose, as often betid them</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.3">While Grendel was holding the gold-bedecked palace,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.4">Ill-deeds performing, till his end overtook him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.5">Death for his sins. ’Twas seen very clearly,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.6">Known unto earth-folk, that still an avenger</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.7">Outlived the loathed one, long since the sorrow</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.8">Caused by the struggle; the mother of Grendel,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.9">Devil-shaped woman, her woe ever minded,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.10">Who was held to inhabit the horrible waters,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.11">The cold-flowing currents, after Cain had become a</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.12">Slayer-with-edges to his one only brother,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.13">The son of his sire; he set out then banished,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.14">Marked as a murderer, man-joys avoiding,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.15">Lived in the desert. Thence demons unnumbered</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.16">Fate-sent awoke; one of them Grendel,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.17">Sword-cursèd, hateful, who at Heorot met with</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.18">A man that was watching, waiting the struggle,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.19">Where a horrid one held him with hand-grapple sturdy;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.20">Nathless he minded the might of his body,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.21">The glorious gift God had allowed him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.22">And folk-ruling Father’s favor relied on,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.23">His help and His comfort: so he conquered the foeman,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.24">The hell-spirit humbled: he unhappy departed then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.25">Reaved of his joyance, journeying to death-haunts,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.26">Foeman of man. His mother moreover</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.27">Eager and gloomy was anxious to go on</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.28">Her mournful mission, mindful of vengeance</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.29">For the death of her son. She came then to Heorot</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.30">Where the Armor-Dane earlmen all through the building</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.31">Were lying in slumber. Soon there became then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.32">Return to the nobles, when the mother of Grendel</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.33">Entered the folk-hall; the fear was less grievous</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.34">By even so much as the vigor of maidens,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.35">War-strength of women, by warrior is reckoned,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.36">When well-carved weapon, worked with the hammer,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.37">Blade very bloody, brave with its edges,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.38">Strikes down the boar-sign that stands on the helmet.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.39">Then the hard-edgèd weapon was heaved in the building,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.40">The brand o’er the benches, broad-lindens many</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.41">Hand-fast were lifted; for helmet he recked not,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.42">For armor-net broad, whom terror laid hold of.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.43">She went then hastily, outward would get her</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.44">Her life for to save, when some one did spy her;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.45">Soon she had grappled one of the athelings</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.46">Fast and firmly, when fenward she hied her;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.47">That one to Hrothgar was liefest of heroes</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.48">In rank of retainer where waters encircle,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.49">A mighty shield-warrior, whom she murdered at slumber,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.50">A broadly-famed battle-knight. Beowulf was absent,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.51">But another apartment was erstwhile devoted</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.52">To the glory-decked Geatman when gold was distributed.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.53">There was hubbub in Heorot. The hand that was famous</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.54">She grasped in its gore; grief was renewed then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.55">In homes and houses: ’twas no happy arrangement</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.56">In both of the quarters to barter and purchase</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.57">With lives of their friends. Then the well-agèd ruler,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.58">The gray-headed war-thane, was woful in spirit,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.59">When his long-trusted liegeman lifeless he knew of,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.60">His dearest one gone. Quick from a room was</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.61">Beowulf brought, brave and triumphant.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.62">As day was dawning in the dusk of the morning,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.63">Went then that earlman, champion noble,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.64">Came with comrades, where the clever one bided</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.65">Whether God all gracious would grant him a respite</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.66">After the woe he had suffered. The war-worthy hero</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.67">With a troop of retainers trod then the pavement</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.68">(The hall-building groaned), till he greeted the wise one,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.69">The earl of the Ingwins; asked if the night had</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XX.70">Fully refreshed him, as fain he would have it.</div>
