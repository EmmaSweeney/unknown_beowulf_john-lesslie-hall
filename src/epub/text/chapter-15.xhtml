				<p>					<span>Hrothgar discoursed (to the hall-building went he,</span>
					<span>He stood by the pillar, saw the steep-rising hall-roof</span>
					<span>Gleaming with gold-gems, and Grendel his hand there):</span>
					<span>“For the sight we behold now, thanks to the Wielder</span>
					<span>Early be offered! Much evil I bided,</span>
					<span>Snaring from Grendel: God can e’er ’complish</span>
					<span>Wonder on wonder, Wielder of Glory!</span>
					<span>But lately I reckoned ne’er under heaven</span>
					<span>Comfort to gain me for any of sorrows,</span>
					<span>While the handsomest of houses horrid with bloodstain</span>
					<span>Gory uptowered; grief had offfrightened</span>
					<span>Each of the wise ones who weened not that ever</span>
					<span>The folk-troop’s defences ’gainst foes they should strengthen,</span>
					<span>’Gainst sprites and monsters. Through the might of the Wielder</span>
					<span>A doughty retainer hath a deed now accomplished</span>
					<span>Which erstwhile we all with our excellent wisdom</span>
					<span>Failed to perform. May affirm very truly</span>
					<span>What woman soever in all of the nations</span>
					<span>Gave birth to the child, if yet she surviveth,</span>
					<span>That the long-ruling Lord was lavish to herward</span>
					<span>In the birth of the bairn. Now, Beowulf dear,</span>
					<span>Most excellent hero, I’ll love thee in spirit</span>
					<span>As bairn of my body; bear well henceforward</span>
					<span>The relationship new. No lack shall befall thee</span>
					<span>Of earth-joys any I ever can give thee.</span>
					<span>Full often for lesser service I’ve given</span>
					<span>Hero less hardy hoard-treasure precious,</span>
					<span>To a weaker in war-strife. By works of distinction</span>
					<span>Thou hast gained for thyself now that thy glory shall flourish</span>
					<span>Forever and ever. The All-Ruler quite thee</span>
					<span>With good from His hand as He hitherto did thee!”</span>
					<span>Beowulf answered, Ecgtheow’s offspring:</span>
					<span>“That labor of glory most gladly achieved we,</span>
					<span>The combat accomplished, unquailing we ventured</span>
					<span>The enemy’s grapple; I would grant it much rather</span>
					<span>Thou wert able to look at the creature in person,</span>
					<span>Faint unto falling, the foe in his trappings!</span>
					<span>On murder-bed quickly I minded to bind him,</span>
					<span>With firm-holding fetters, that forced by my grapple</span>
					<span>Low he should lie in life-and-death struggle</span>
					<span>’Less his body escape; I was wholly unable,</span>
					<span>Since God did not will it, to keep him from going,</span>
					<span>Not held him that firmly, hated opposer;</span>
					<span>Too swift was the foeman. Yet safety regarding</span>
					<span>He suffered his hand behind him to linger,</span>
					<span>His arm and shoulder, to act as watcher;</span>
					<span>No shadow of solace the woe-begone creature</span>
					<span>Found him there nathless: the hated destroyer</span>
					<span>Liveth no longer, lashed for his evils,</span>
					<span>But sorrow hath seized him, in snare-meshes hath him</span>
					<span>Close in its clutches, keepeth him writhing</span>
					<span>In baleful bonds: there banished for evil</span>
					<span>The man shall wait for the mighty tribunal,</span>
					<span>How the God of glory shall give him his earnings.”</span>
					<span>Then the soldier kept silent, son of old Ecglaf,</span>
					<span>From boasting and bragging of battle-achievements,</span>
					<span>Since the princes beheld there the hand that depended</span>
					<span>’Neath the lofty hall-timbers by the might of the nobleman,</span>
					<span>Each one before him, the enemy’s fingers;</span>
					<span>Each finger-nail strong steel most resembled,</span>
					<span>The heathen one’s hand-spur, the hero-in-battle’s</span>
					<span>Claw most uncanny; quoth they agreeing,</span>
					<span>That not any excellent edges of brave ones</span>
					<span>Was willing to touch him, the terrible creature’s</span>
					<span>Battle-hand bloody to bear away from him.</span>
