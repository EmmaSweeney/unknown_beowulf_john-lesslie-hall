<h2>
<span>XXXVIII.</span>
<span>WIGLAF PLUNDERS THE DRAGON’S DEN.—BEOWULF’S DEATH.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.1">Then heard I that Wihstan’s son very quickly,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.2">These words being uttered, heeded his liegelord</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.3">Wounded and war-sick, went in his armor,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.4">His well-woven ring-mail, ’neath the roof of the barrow.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.5">Then the trusty retainer treasure-gems many</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.6">Victorious saw, when the seat he came near to,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.7">Gold-treasure sparkling spread on the bottom,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.8">Wonder on the wall, and the worm-creature’s cavern,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.9">The ancient dawn-flier’s, vessels a-standing,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.10">Cups of the ancients of cleansers bereavèd,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.11">Robbed of their ornaments: there were helmets in numbers,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.12">Old and rust-eaten, arm-bracelets many,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.13">Artfully woven. Wealth can easily,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.14">Gold on the sea-bottom, turn into vanity</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.15">Each one of earthmen, arm him who pleaseth!</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.16">And he saw there lying an all-golden banner</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.17">High o’er the hoard, of hand-wonders greatest,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.18">Linkèd with lacets: a light from it sparkled,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.19">That the floor of the cavern he was able to look on,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.20">To examine the jewels. Sight of the dragon</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.21">Not any was offered, but edge offcarried him.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.22">Then I heard that the hero the hoard-treasure plundered,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.23">The giant-work ancient reaved in the cavern,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.24">Bare on his bosom the beakers and platters,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.25">As himself would fain have it, and took off the standard,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.26">The brightest of beacons; the bill had erst injured</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.27">(Its edge was of iron), the old-ruler’s weapon,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.28">Him who long had watched as ward of the jewels,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.29">Who fire-terror carried hot for the treasure,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.30">Rolling in battle, in middlemost darkness,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.31">Till murdered he perished. The messenger hastened,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.32">Not loth to return, hurried by jewels:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.33">Curiosity urged him if, excellent-mooded,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.34">Alive he should find the lord of the Weders</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.35">Mortally wounded, at the place where he left him.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.36">’Mid the jewels he found then the famous old chieftain,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.37">His liegelord belovèd, at his life’s-end gory:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.38">He thereupon ’gan to lave him with water,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.39">Till the point of his word piercèd his breast-hoard.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.40">Beowulf spake (the gold-gems he noticed),</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.41">The old one in sorrow: “For the jewels I look on</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.42">Thanks do I utter for all to the Ruler,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.43">Wielder of Worship, with words of devotion,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.44">The Lord everlasting, that He let me such treasures</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.45">Gain for my people ere death overtook me.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.46">Since I’ve bartered the agèd life to me granted</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.47">For treasure of jewels, attend ye henceforward</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.48">The wants of the war-thanes; I can wait here no longer.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.49">The battle-famed bid ye to build them a grave-hill,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.50">Bright when I’m burned, at the brim-current’s limit;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.51">As a memory-mark to the men I have governed,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.52">Aloft it shall tower on Whale’s-Ness uprising,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.53">That earls of the ocean hereafter may call it</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.54">Beowulf’s barrow, those who barks ever-dashing</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.55">From a distance shall drive o’er the darkness of waters.”</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.56">The bold-mooded troop-lord took from his neck then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.57">The ring that was golden, gave to his liegeman,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.58">The youthful war-hero, his gold-flashing helmet,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.59">His collar and war-mail, bade him well to enjoy them:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.60">“Thou art latest left of the line of our kindred,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.61">Of Wægmunding people: Weird hath offcarried</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.62">All of my kinsmen to the Creator’s glory,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.63">Earls in their vigor: I shall after them fare.”</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.64">’Twas the aged liegelord’s last-spoken word in</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.65">His musings of spirit, ere he mounted the fire,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.66">The battle-waves burning: from his bosom departed</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVIII.67">His soul to seek the sainted ones’ glory.</div>
