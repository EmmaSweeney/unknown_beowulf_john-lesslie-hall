<h2>
<span>XLII.</span>
<span>WIGLAF’S SAD STORY.—THE HOARD CARRIED OFF.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>Then ’twas seen that the journey prospered him little</span>
<span>Who wrongly within had the ornaments hidden</span>
<span>Down ’neath the wall. The warden erst slaughtered</span>
<span>Some few of the folk-troop: the feud then thereafter</span>
<span>Was hotly avengèd. ’Tis a wonder where,</span>
<span>When the strength-famous trooper has attained to the end of</span>
<span>Life-days allotted, then no longer the man may</span>
<span>Remain with his kinsmen where mead-cups are flowing.</span>
<span>So to Beowulf happened when the ward of the barrow,</span>
<span>Assaults, he sought for: himself had no knowledge</span>
<span>How his leaving this life was likely to happen.</span>
<span>So to doomsday, famous folk-leaders down did</span>
<span>Call it with curses—who ’complished it there—</span>
<span>That that man should be ever of ill-deeds convicted,</span>
<span>Confined in foul-places, fastened in hell-bonds,</span>
<span>Punished with plagues, who this place should e’er ravage.</span>
<span>He cared not for gold: rather the Wielder’s</span>
<span>Favor preferred he first to get sight of.</span>
<span>Wiglaf discoursed then, Wihstan his son:</span>
<span>“Oft many an earlman on one man’s account must</span>
<span>Sorrow endure, as to us it hath happened.</span>
<span>The liegelord belovèd we could little prevail on,</span>
<span>Kingdom’s keeper, counsel to follow,</span>
<span>Not to go to the guardian of the gold-hoard, but let him</span>
<span>Lie where he long was, live in his dwelling</span>
<span>Till the end of the world. Met we a destiny</span>
<span>Hard to endure: the hoard has been looked at,</span>
<span>Been gained very grimly; too grievous the fate that</span>
<span>The prince of the people pricked to come thither.</span>
<span><i>I</i> was therein and all of it looked at,</span>
<span>The building’s equipments, since access was given me,</span>
<span>Not kindly at all entrance permitted</span>
<span>Within under earth-wall. Hastily seized I</span>
<span>And held in my hands a huge-weighing burden</span>
<span>Of hoard-treasures costly, hither out bare them</span>
<span>To my liegelord belovèd: life was yet in him,</span>
<span>And consciousness also; the old one discoursed then</span>
<span>Much and mournfully, commanded to greet you,</span>
<span>Bade that remembering the deeds of your friend-lord</span>
<span>Ye build on the fire-hill of corpses a lofty</span>
<span>Burial-barrow, broad and far-famous,</span>
<span>As ’mid world-dwelling warriors he was widely most honored</span>
<span>While he reveled in riches. Let us rouse us and hasten</span>
<span>Again to see and seek for the treasure,</span>
<span>The wonder ’neath wall. The way I will show you,</span>
<span>That close ye may look at ring-gems sufficient</span>
<span>And gold in abundance. Let the bier with promptness</span>
<span>Fully be fashioned, when forth we shall come,</span>
<span>And lift we our lord, then, where long he shall tarry,</span>
<span>Well-beloved warrior, ’neath the Wielder’s protection.”</span>
<span>Then the son of Wihstan bade orders be given,</span>
<span>Mood-valiant man, to many of heroes,</span>
<span>Holders of homesteads, that they hither from far,</span>
<span>Leaders of liegemen, should look for the good one</span>
<span>With wood for his pyre: “The flame shall now swallow</span>
<span>(The wan fire shall wax) the warriors’ leader</span>
<span>Who the rain of the iron often abided,</span>
<span>When, sturdily hurled, the storm of the arrows</span>
<span>Leapt o’er linden-wall, the lance rendered service,</span>
<span>Furnished with feathers followed the arrow.”</span>
<span>Now the wise-mooded son of Wihstan did summon</span>
<span>The best of the braves from the band of the ruler</span>
<span>Seven together; ’neath the enemy’s roof he</span>
<span>Went with the seven; one of the heroes</span>
<span>Who fared at the front, a fire-blazing torch-light</span>
<span>Bare in his hand. No lot then decided</span>
<span>Who that hoard should havoc, when hero-earls saw it</span>
<span>Lying in the cavern uncared-for entirely,</span>
<span>Rusting to ruin: they rued then but little</span>
<span>That they hastily hence hauled out the treasure,</span>
<span>The dear-valued jewels; the dragon eke pushed they,</span>
<span>The worm o’er the wall, let the wave-currents take him,</span>
<span>The waters enwind the ward of the treasures.</span>
<span>There wounden gold on a wain was uploaded,</span>
<span>A mass unmeasured, the men-leader off then,</span>
<span>The hero hoary, to Whale’s-Ness was carried.</span>
