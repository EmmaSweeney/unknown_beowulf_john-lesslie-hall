				<p>					<span>“So ill-meaning enemies often did cause me</span>
					<span>Sorrow the sorest. I served them, in quittance,</span>
					<span>With my dear-lovèd sword, as in sooth it was fitting;</span>
					<span>They missed the pleasure of feasting abundantly,</span>
					<span>Ill-doers evil, of eating my body,</span>
					<span>Of surrounding the banquet deep in the ocean;</span>
					<span>But wounded with edges early at morning</span>
					<span>They were stretched a-high on the strand of the ocean,</span>
					<span>Put to sleep with the sword, that sea-going travelers</span>
					<span>No longer thereafter were hindered from sailing</span>
					<span>The foam-dashing currents. Came a light from the east,</span>
					<span>God’s beautiful beacon; the billows subsided,</span>
					<span>That well I could see the nesses projecting,</span>
					<span>The blustering crags. Weird often saveth</span>
					<span>The undoomed hero if doughty his valor!</span>
					<span>But me did it fortune to fell with my weapon</span>
					<span>Nine of the nickers. Of night-struggle harder</span>
					<span>’Neath dome of the heaven heard I but rarely,</span>
					<span>Nor of wight more woful in the waves of the ocean;</span>
					<span>Yet I ’scaped with my life the grip of the monsters,</span>
					<span>Weary from travel. Then the waters bare me</span>
					<span>To the land of the Finns, the flood with the current,</span>
					<span>The weltering waves. Not a word hath been told me</span>
					<span>Of deeds so daring done by thee, Unferth,</span>
					<span>And of sword-terror none; never hath Breca</span>
					<span>At the play of the battle, nor either of you two,</span>
					<span>Feat so fearless performèd with weapons</span>
					<span>Glinting and gleaming …  …  …  …</span>
					<span>…  …  …  … I utter no boasting;</span>
					<span>Though with cold-blooded cruelty thou killedst thy brothers,</span>
					<span>Thy nearest of kin; thou needs must in hell get</span>
					<span>Direful damnation, though doughty thy wisdom.</span>
					<span>I tell thee in earnest, offspring of Ecglaf,</span>
					<span>Never had Grendel such numberless horrors,</span>
					<span>The direful demon, done to thy liegelord,</span>
					<span>Harrying in Heorot, if thy heart were as sturdy,</span>
					<span>Thy mood as ferocious as thou dost describe them.</span>
					<span>He hath found out fully that the fierce-burning hatred,</span>
					<span>The edge-battle eager, of all of your kindred,</span>
					<span>Of the Victory-Scyldings, need little dismay him:</span>
					<span>Oaths he exacteth, not any he spares</span>
					<span>Of the folk of the Danemen, but fighteth with pleasure,</span>
					<span>Killeth and feasteth, no contest expecteth</span>
					<span>From Spear-Danish people. But the prowess and valor</span>
					<span>Of the earls of the Geatmen early shall venture</span>
					<span>To give him a grapple. He shall go who is able</span>
					<span>Bravely to banquet, when the bright-light of morning</span>
					<span>Which the second day bringeth, the sun in its ether-robes,</span>
					<span>O’er children of men shines from the southward!”</span>
					<span>Then the gray-haired, war-famed giver of treasure</span>
					<span>Was blithesome and joyous, the Bright-Danish ruler</span>
					<span>Expected assistance; the people’s protector</span>
					<span>Heard from Beowulf his bold resolution.</span>
					<span>There was laughter of heroes; loud was the clatter,</span>
					<span>The words were winsome. Wealhtheow advanced then,</span>
					<span>Consort of Hrothgar, of courtesy mindful,</span>
					<span>Gold-decked saluted the men in the building,</span>
					<span>And the freeborn woman the beaker presented</span>
					<span>To the lord of the kingdom, first of the East-Danes,</span>
					<span>Bade him be blithesome when beer was a-flowing,</span>
					<span>Lief to his liegemen; he lustily tasted</span>
					<span>Of banquet and beaker, battle-famed ruler.</span>
					<span>The Helmingish lady then graciously circled</span>
					<span>’Mid all the liegemen lesser and greater:</span>
					<span>Treasure-cups tendered, till time was afforded</span>
					<span>That the decorous-mooded, diademed folk-queen</span>
					<span>Might bear to Beowulf the bumper o’errunning;</span>
					<span>She greeted the Geat-prince, God she did thank,</span>
					<span>Most wise in her words, that her wish was accomplished,</span>
					<span>That in any of earlmen she ever should look for</span>
					<span>Solace in sorrow. He accepted the beaker,</span>
					<span>Battle-bold warrior, at Wealhtheow’s giving,</span>
					<span>Then equipped for combat quoth he in measures,</span>
					<span>Beowulf spake, offspring of Ecgtheow:</span>
					<span>“I purposed in spirit when I mounted the ocean,</span>
					<span>When I boarded my boat with a band of my liegemen,</span>
					<span>I would work to the fullest the will of your people</span>
					<span>Or in foe’s-clutches fastened fall in the battle.</span>
					<span>Deeds I shall do of daring and prowess,</span>
					<span>Or the last of my life-days live in this mead-hall.”</span>
					<span>These words to the lady were welcome and pleasing,</span>
					<span>The boast of the Geatman; with gold trappings broidered</span>
					<span>Went the freeborn folk-queen her fond-lord to sit by.</span>
					<span>Then again as of yore was heard in the building</span>
					<span>Courtly discussion, conquerors’ shouting,</span>
					<span>Heroes were happy, till Healfdene’s son would</span>
					<span>Go to his slumber to seek for refreshing;</span>
					<span>For the horrid hell-monster in the hall-building knew he</span>
					<span>A fight was determined, since the light of the sun they</span>
					<span>No longer could see, and lowering darkness</span>
					<span>O’er all had descended, and dark under heaven</span>
					<span>Shadowy shapes came shying around them.</span>
					<span>The liegemen all rose then. One saluted the other,</span>
					<span>Hrothgar Beowulf, in rhythmical measures,</span>
					<span>Wishing him well, and, the wassail-hall giving</span>
					<span>To his care and keeping, quoth he departing:</span>
					<span>“Not to any one else have I ever entrusted,</span>
					<span>But thee and thee only, the hall of the Danemen,</span>
					<span>Since high I could heave my hand and my buckler.</span>
					<span>Take thou in charge now the noblest of houses;</span>
					<span>Be mindful of honor, exhibiting prowess,</span>
					<span>Watch ’gainst the foeman! Thou shalt want no enjoyments,</span>
					<span>Survive thou safely adventure so glorious!”</span>
