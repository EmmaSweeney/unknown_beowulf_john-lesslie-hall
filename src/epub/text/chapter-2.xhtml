					<span>In the boroughs then Beowulf, bairn of the Scyldings,</span>
					<span>Belovèd land-prince, for long-lasting season</span>
					<span>Was famed mid the folk (his father departed,</span>
					<span>The prince from his dwelling), till afterward sprang</span>
					<span>Great-minded Healfdene; the Danes in his lifetime</span>
					<span>He graciously governed, grim-mooded, agèd.</span>
					<span>Four bairns of his body born in succession</span>
					<span>Woke in the world, war-troopers’ leader</span>
					<span>Heorogar, Hrothgar, and Halga the good;</span>
					<span>Heard I that Elan was Ongentheow’s consort,</span>
					<span>The well-beloved bedmate of the War-Scylfing leader.</span>
					<span>Then glory in battle to Hrothgar was given,</span>
					<span>Waxing of war-fame, that willingly kinsmen</span>
					<span>Obeyed his bidding, till the boys grew to manhood,</span>
					<span>A numerous band. It burned in his spirit</span>
					<span>To urge his folk to found a great building,</span>
					<span>A mead-hall grander than men of the era</span>
					<span>Ever had heard of, and in it to share</span>
					<span>With young and old all of the blessings</span>
					<span>The Lord had allowed him, save life and retainers.</span>
					<span>Then the work I find afar was assigned</span>
					<span>To many races in middle-earth’s regions,</span>
					<span>To adorn the great folk-hall. In due time it happened</span>
					<span>Early ’mong men, that ’twas finished entirely,</span>
					<span>The greatest of hall-buildings; Heorot he named it</span>
					<span>Who wide-reaching word-sway wielded ’mong earlmen.</span>
					<span>His promise he brake not, rings he lavished,</span>
					<span>Treasure at banquet. Towered the hall up</span>
					<span>High and horn-crested, huge between antlers:</span>
					<span>It battle-waves bided, the blasting fire-demon;</span>
					<span>Ere long then from hottest hatred must sword-wrath</span>
					<span>Arise for a woman’s husband and father.</span>
					<span>Then the mighty war-spirit endured for a season,</span>
					<span>Bore it bitterly, he who bided in darkness,</span>
					<span>That light-hearted laughter loud in the building</span>
					<span>Greeted him daily; there was dulcet harp-music,</span>
					<span>Clear song of the singer. He said that was able</span>
					<span>To tell from of old earthmen’s beginnings,</span>
					<span>That Father Almighty earth had created,</span>
					<span>The winsome wold that the water encircleth,</span>
					<span>Set exultingly the sun’s and the moon’s beams</span>
					<span>To lavish their lustre on land-folk and races,</span>
					<span>And earth He embellished in all her regions</span>
					<span>With limbs and leaves; life He bestowed too</span>
					<span>On all the kindreds that live under heaven.</span>
					<span>So blessed with abundance, brimming with joyance,</span>
					<span>The warriors abided, till a certain one gan to</span>
					<span>Dog them with deeds of direfullest malice,</span>
					<span>A foe in the hall-building: this horrible stranger</span>
					<span>Was Grendel entitled, the march-stepper famous</span>
					<span>Who dwelt in the moor-fens, the marsh and the fastness;</span>
					<span>The wan-mooded being abode for a season</span>
					<span>In the land of the giants, when the Lord and Creator</span>
					<span>Had banned him and branded. For that bitter murder,</span>
					<span>The killing of Abel, all-ruling Father</span>
					<span>The kindred of Cain crushed with His vengeance;</span>
					<span>In the feud He rejoiced not, but far away drove him</span>
					<span>From kindred and kind, that crime to atone for,</span>
					<span>Meter of Justice. Thence ill-favored creatures,</span>
					<span>Elves and giants, monsters of ocean,</span>
					<span>Came into being, and the giants that longtime</span>
					<span>Grappled with God; He gave them requital.</span>
