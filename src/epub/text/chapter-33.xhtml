<h2>
<span>XXXIII.</span>
<span>BRAVE THOUGH AGED.—REMINISCENCES.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.1">The stranger began then to vomit forth fire,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.2">To burn the great manor; the blaze then glimmered</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.3">For anguish to earlmen, not anything living</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.4">Was the hateful air-goer willing to leave there.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.5">The war of the worm widely was noticed,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.6">The feud of the foeman afar and anear,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.7">How the enemy injured the earls of the Geatmen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.8">Harried with hatred: back he hied to the treasure,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.9">To the well-hidden cavern ere the coming of daylight.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.10">He had circled with fire the folk of those regions,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.11">With brand and burning; in the barrow he trusted,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.12">In the wall and his war-might: the weening deceived him.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.13">Then straight was the horror to Beowulf published,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.14">Early forsooth, that his own native homestead,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.15">The best of buildings, was burning and melting,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.16">Gift-seat of Geatmen. ’Twas a grief to the spirit</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.17">Of the good-mooded hero, the greatest of sorrows:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.18">The wise one weened then that wielding his kingdom</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.19">’Gainst the ancient commandments, he had bitterly angered</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.20">The Lord everlasting: with lorn meditations</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.21">His bosom welled inward, as was nowise his custom.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.22">The fire-spewing dragon fully had wasted</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.23">The fastness of warriors, the water-land outward,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.24">The manor with fire. The folk-ruling hero,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.25">Prince of the Weders, was planning to wreak him.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.26">The warmen’s defender bade them to make him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.27">Earlmen’s atheling, an excellent war-shield</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.28">Wholly of iron: fully he knew then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.29">That wood from the forest was helpless to aid him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.30">Shield against fire. The long-worthy ruler</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.31">Must live the last of his limited earth-days,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.32">Of life in the world and the worm along with him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.33">Though he long had been holding hoard-wealth in plenty.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.34">Then the ring-prince disdained to seek with a war-band,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.35">With army extensive, the air-going ranger;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.36">He felt no fear of the foeman’s assaults and</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.37">He counted for little the might of the dragon,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.38">His power and prowess: for previously dared he</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.39">A heap of hostility, hazarded dangers,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.40">War-thane, when Hrothgar’s palace he cleansèd,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.41">Conquering combatant, clutched in the battle</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.42">The kinsmen of Grendel, of kindred detested.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.43">’Twas of hand-fights not least where Higelac was slaughtered,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.44">When the king of the Geatmen with clashings of battle,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.45">Friend-lord of folks in Frisian dominions,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.46">Offspring of Hrethrel perished through sword-drink,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.47">With battle-swords beaten; thence Beowulf came then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.48">On self-help relying, swam through the waters;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.49">He bare on his arm, lone-going, thirty</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.50">Outfits of armor, when the ocean he mounted.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.51">The Hetwars by no means had need to be boastful</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.52">Of their fighting afoot, who forward to meet him</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.53">Carried their war-shields: not many returned from</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.54">The brave-mooded battle-knight back to their homesteads.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.55">Ecgtheow’s bairn o’er the bight-courses swam then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.56">Lone-goer lorn to his land-folk returning,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.57">Where Hygd to him tendered treasure and kingdom,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.58">Rings and dominion: her son she not trusted,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.59">To be able to keep the kingdom devised him</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.60">’Gainst alien races, on the death of King Higelac.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.61">Yet the sad ones succeeded not in persuading the atheling</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.62">In any way ever, to act as a suzerain</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.63">To Heardred, or promise to govern the kingdom;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.64">Yet with friendly counsel in the folk he sustained him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.65">Gracious, with honor, till he grew to be older,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.66">Wielded the Weders. Wide-fleeing outlaws,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.67">Ohthere’s sons, sought him o’er the waters:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.68">They had stirred a revolt ’gainst the helm of the Scylfings,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.69">The best of the sea-kings, who in Swedish dominions</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.70">Distributed treasure, distinguished folk-leader.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.71">’Twas the end of his earth-days; injury fatal</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.72">By swing of the sword he received as a greeting,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.73">Offspring of Higelac; Ongentheow’s bairn</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.74">Later departed to visit his homestead,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.75">When Heardred was dead; let Beowulf rule them,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIII.76">Govern the Geatmen: good was that folk-king.</div>
