<h2>
<span>XXXIX.</span>
<span>THE DEAD FOES.—WIGLAF’S BITTER TAUNTS.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.1">It had wofully chanced then the youthful retainer</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.2">To behold on earth the most ardent-belovèd</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.3">At his life-days’ limit, lying there helpless.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.4">The slayer too lay there, of life all bereavèd,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.5">Horrible earth-drake, harassed with sorrow:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.6">The round-twisted monster was permitted no longer</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.7">To govern the ring-hoards, but edges of war-swords</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.8">Mightily seized him, battle-sharp, sturdy</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.9">Leavings of hammers, that still from his wounds</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.10">The flier-from-farland fell to the earth</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.11">Hard by his hoard-house, hopped he at midnight</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.12">Not e’er through the air, nor exulting in jewels</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.13">Suffered them to see him: but he sank then to earthward</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.14">Through the hero-chief’s handwork. I heard sure it throve then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.15">But few in the land of liegemen of valor,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.16">Though of every achievement bold he had proved him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.17">To run ’gainst the breath of the venomous scather,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.18">Or the hall of the treasure to trouble with hand-blows,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.19">If he watching had found the ward of the hoard-hall</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.20">On the barrow abiding. Beowulf’s part of</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.21">The treasure of jewels was paid for with death;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.22">Each of the twain had attained to the end of</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.23">Life so unlasting. Not long was the time till</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.24">The tardy-at-battle returned from the thicket,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.25">The timid truce-breakers ten all together,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.26">Who durst not before play with the lances</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.27">In the prince of the people’s pressing emergency;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.28">But blushing with shame, with shields they betook them,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.29">With arms and armor where the old one was lying:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.30">They gazed upon Wiglaf. He was sitting exhausted,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.31">Foot-going fighter, not far from the shoulders</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.32">Of the lord of the people, would rouse him with water;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.33">No whit did it help him; though he hoped for it keenly,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.34">He was able on earth not at all in the leader</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.35">Life to retain, and nowise to alter</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.36">The will of the Wielder; the World-Ruler’s power</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.37">Would govern the actions of each one of heroes,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.38">As yet He is doing. From the young one forthwith then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.39">Could grim-worded greeting be got for him quickly</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.40">Whose courage had failed him. Wiglaf discoursed then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.41">Weohstan his son, sad-mooded hero,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.42">Looked on the hated: “He who soothness will utter</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.43">Can say that the liegelord who gave you the jewels,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.44">The ornament-armor wherein ye are standing,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.45">When on ale-bench often he offered to hall-men</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.46">Helmet and burnie, the prince to his liegemen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.47">As best upon earth he was able to find him,—</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.48">That he wildly wasted his war-gear undoubtedly</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.49">When battle o’ertook him. The troop-king no need had</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.50">To glory in comrades; yet God permitted him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.51">Victory-Wielder, with weapon unaided</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.52">Himself to avenge, when vigor was needed.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.53">I life-protection but little was able</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.54">To give him in battle, and I ’gan, notwithstanding,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.55">Helping my kinsman (my strength overtaxing):</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.56">He waxed the weaker when with weapon I smote on</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.57">My mortal opponent, the fire less strongly</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.58">Flamed from his bosom. Too few of protectors</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.59">Came round the king at the critical moment.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.60">Now must ornament-taking and weapon-bestowing,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.61">Home-joyance all, cease for your kindred,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.62">Food for the people; each of your warriors</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.63">Must needs be bereavèd of rights that he holdeth</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.64">In landed possessions, when faraway nobles</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.65">Shall learn of your leaving your lord so basely,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.66">The dastardly deed. Death is more pleasant</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXIX.67">To every earlman than infamous life is!”</div>
