<h2>
<span>XXXVII.</span>
<span>THE FATAL STRUGGLE.—BEOWULF’S LAST MOMENTS.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.1">Then I heard that at need of the king of the people</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.2">The upstanding earlman exhibited prowess,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.3">Vigor and courage, as suited his nature;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.4">He his head did not guard, but the high-minded liegeman’s</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.5">Hand was consumed, when he succored his kinsman,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.6">So he struck the strife-bringing strange-comer lower,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.7">Earl-thane in armor, that <i>in</i> went the weapon</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.8">Gleaming and plated, that ’gan then the fire</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.9">Later to lessen. The liegelord himself then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.10">Retained his consciousness, brandished his war-knife,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.11">Battle-sharp, bitter, that he bare on his armor:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.12">The Weder-lord cut the worm in the middle.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.13">They had felled the enemy (life drove out then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.14">Puissant prowess), the pair had destroyed him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.15">Land-chiefs related: so a liegeman should prove him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.16">A thaneman when needed. To the prince ’twas the last of</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.17">His era of conquest by his own great achievements,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.18">The latest of world-deeds. The wound then began</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.19">Which the earth-dwelling dragon erstwhile had wrought him</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.20">To burn and to swell. He soon then discovered</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.21">That bitterest bale-woe in his bosom was raging,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.22">Poison within. The atheling advanced then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.23">That along by the wall, he prudent of spirit</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.24">Might sit on a settle; he saw the giant-work,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.25">How arches of stone strengthened with pillars</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.26">The earth-hall eternal inward supported.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.27">Then the long-worthy liegeman laved with his hand the</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.28">Far-famous chieftain, gory from sword-edge,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.29">Refreshing the face of his friend-lord and ruler,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.30">Sated with battle, unbinding his helmet.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.31">Beowulf answered, of his injury spake he,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.32">His wound that was fatal (he was fully aware</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.33">He had lived his allotted life-days enjoying</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.34">The pleasures of earth; then past was entirely</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.35">His measure of days, death very near):</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.36">“My son I would give now my battle-equipments,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.37">Had any of heirs been after me granted,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.38">Along of my body. This people I governed</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.39">Fifty of winters: no king ’mong my neighbors</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.40">Dared to encounter me with comrades-in-battle,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.41">Try me with terror. The time to me ordered</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.42">I bided at home, mine own kept fitly,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.43">Sought me no snares, swore me not many</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.44">Oaths in injustice. Joy over all this</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.45">I’m able to have, though ill with my death-wounds;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.46">Hence the Ruler of Earthmen need not charge me</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.47">With the killing of kinsmen, when cometh my life out</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.48">Forth from my body. Fare thou with haste now</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.49">To behold the hoard ’neath the hoar-grayish stone,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.50">Well-lovèd Wiglaf, now the worm is a-lying,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.51">Sore-wounded sleepeth, disseized of his treasure.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.52">Go thou in haste that treasures of old I,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.53">Gold-wealth may gaze on, together see lying</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.54">The ether-bright jewels, be easier able,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.55">Having the heap of hoard-gems, to yield my</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXVII.56">Life and the land-folk whom long I have governed.”</div>
