<h2>
<span>VIII.</span>
<span>HROTHGAR AND BEOWULF.—<i>Continued</i>.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.1">Hrothgar discoursed, helm of the Scyldings:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.2">“To defend our folk and to furnish assistance,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.3">Thou soughtest us hither, good friend Beowulf.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.4">The fiercest of feuds thy father engaged in,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.5">Heatholaf killed he in hand-to-hand conflict</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.6">’Mid Wilfingish warriors; then the Wederish people</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.7">For fear of a feud were forced to disown him.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.8">Thence flying he fled to the folk of the South-Danes,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.9">The race of the Scyldings, o’er the roll of the waters;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.10">I had lately begun then to govern the Danemen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.11">The hoard-seat of heroes held in my youth,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.12">Rich in its jewels: dead was Heregar,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.13">My kinsman and elder had earth-joys forsaken,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.14">Healfdene his bairn. He was better than I am!</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.15">That feud thereafter for a fee I compounded;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.16">O’er the weltering waters to the Wilfings I sent</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.17">Ornaments old; oaths did he swear me.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.18">It pains me in spirit to any to tell it,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.19">What grief in Heorot Grendel hath caused me,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.20">What horror unlooked-for, by hatred unceasing.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.21">Waned is my war-band, wasted my hall-troop;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.22">Weird hath offcast them to the clutches of Grendel.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.23">God can easily hinder the scather</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.24">From deeds so direful. Oft drunken with beer</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.25">O’er the ale-vessel promised warriors in armor</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.26">They would willingly wait on the wassailing-benches</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.27">A grapple with Grendel, with grimmest of edges.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.28">Then this mead-hall at morning with murder was reeking,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.29">The building was bloody at breaking of daylight,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.30">The bench-deals all flooded, dripping and bloodied,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.31">The folk-hall was gory: I had fewer retainers,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.32">Dear-beloved warriors, whom death had laid hold of.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.33">Sit at the feast now, thy intents unto heroes,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.34">Thy victor-fame show, as thy spirit doth urge thee!”</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.35">For the men of the Geats then together assembled,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.36">In the beer-hall blithesome a bench was made ready;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.37">There warlike in spirit they went to be seated,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.38">Proud and exultant. A liegeman did service,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.39">Who a beaker embellished bore with decorum,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.40">And gleaming-drink poured. The gleeman sang whilom</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.41">Hearty in Heorot; there was heroes’ rejoicing,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.VIII.42">A numerous war-band of Weders and Danemen.</div>
