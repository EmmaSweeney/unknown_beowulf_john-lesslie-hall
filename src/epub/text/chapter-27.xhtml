<h2>
<span>XXVII.</span>
<span>SORROW AT PARTING.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.1">Beowulf spake, Ecgtheow’s offspring:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.2">“We men of the water wish to declare now</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.3">Fared from far-lands, we’re firmly determined</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.4">To seek King Higelac. Here have we fitly</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.5">Been welcomed and feasted, as heart would desire it;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.6">Good was the greeting. If greater affection</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.7">I am anywise able ever on earth to</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.8">Gain at thy hands, ruler of heroes,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.9">Than yet I have done, I shall quickly be ready</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.10">For combat and conflict. O’er the course of the waters</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.11">Learn I that neighbors alarm thee with terror,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.12">As haters did whilom, I hither will bring thee</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.13">For help unto heroes henchmen by thousands.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.14">I know as to Higelac, the lord of the Geatmen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.15">Though young in years, he yet will permit me,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.16">By words and by works, ward of the people,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.17">Fully to furnish thee forces and bear thee</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.18">My lance to relieve thee, if liegemen shall fail thee,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.19">And help of my hand-strength; if Hrethric be treating,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.20">Bairn of the king, at the court of the Geatmen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.21">He thereat may find him friends in abundance:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.22">Faraway countries he were better to seek for</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.23">Who trusts in himself.” Hrothgar discoursed then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.24">Making rejoinder: “These words thou hast uttered</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.25">All-knowing God hath given thy spirit!</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.26">Ne’er heard I an earlman thus early in life</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.27">More clever in speaking: thou’rt cautious of spirit,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.28">Mighty of muscle, in mouth-answers prudent.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.29">I count on the hope that, happen it ever</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.30">That missile shall rob thee of Hrethel’s descendant,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.31">Edge-horrid battle, and illness or weapon</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.32">Deprive thee of prince, of people’s protector,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.33">And life thou yet holdest, the Sea-Geats will never</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.34">Find a more fitting folk-lord to choose them,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.35">Gem-ward of heroes, than <i>thou</i> mightest prove thee,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.36">If the kingdom of kinsmen thou carest to govern.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.37">Thy mood-spirit likes me the longer the better,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.38">Beowulf dear: thou hast brought it to pass that</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.39">To both these peoples peace shall be common,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.40">To Geat-folk and Danemen, the strife be suspended,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.41">The secret assailings they suffered in yore-days;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.42">And also that jewels be shared while I govern</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.43">The wide-stretching kingdom, and that many shall visit</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.44">Others o’er the ocean with excellent gift-gems:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.45">The ring-adorned bark shall bring o’er the currents</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.46">Presents and love-gifts. This people I know</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.47">Tow’rd foeman and friend firmly established,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.48">After ancient etiquette everywise blameless.”</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.49">Then the warden of earlmen gave him still farther,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.50">Kinsman of Healfdene, a dozen of jewels,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.51">Bade him safely seek with the presents</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.52">His well-beloved people, early returning.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.53">Then the noble-born king kissed the distinguished,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.54">Dear-lovèd liegeman, the Dane-prince saluted him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.55">And claspèd his neck; tears from him fell,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.56">From the gray-headed man: he two things expected,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.57">Agèd and reverend, but rather the second,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.58">That bold in council they’d meet thereafter.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.59">The man was so dear that he failed to suppress the</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.60">Emotions that moved him, but in mood-fetters fastened</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.61">The long-famous hero longeth in secret</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.62">Deep in his spirit for the dear-beloved man</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.63">Though not a blood-kinsman. Beowulf thenceward,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.64">Gold-splendid warrior, walked o’er the meadows</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.65">Exulting in treasure: the sea-going vessel</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.66">Riding at anchor awaited its owner.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.67">As they pressed on their way then, the present of Hrothgar</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.68">Was frequently referred to: a folk-king indeed that</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.69">Everyway blameless, till age did debar him</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXVII.70">The joys of his might, which hath many oft injured.</div>
