<h2>
<span>XXXI.</span>
<span>GIFT-GIVING IS MUTUAL.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>“So the belovèd land-prince lived in decorum;</span>
<span>I had missed no rewards, no meeds of my prowess,</span>
<span>But he gave me jewels, regarding my wishes,</span>
<span>Healfdene his bairn; I’ll bring them to thee, then,</span>
<span>Atheling of earlmen, offer them gladly.</span>
<span>And still unto thee is all my affection:</span>
<span>But few of my folk-kin find I surviving</span>
<span>But thee, dear Higelac!” Bade he in then to carry</span>
<span>The boar-image, banner, battle-high helmet,</span>
<span>Iron-gray armor, the excellent weapon,</span>
<span>In song-measures said: “This suit-for-the-battle</span>
<span>Hrothgar presented me, bade me expressly,</span>
<span>Wise-mooded atheling, thereafter to tell thee</span>
<span>The whole of its history, said King Heregar owned it,</span>
<span>Dane-prince for long: yet he wished not to give then</span>
<span>The mail to his son, though dearly he loved him,</span>
<span>Hereward the hardy. Hold all in joyance!”</span>
<span>I heard that there followed hard on the jewels</span>
<span>Two braces of stallions of striking resemblance,</span>
<span>Dappled and yellow; he granted him usance</span>
<span>Of horses and treasures. So a kinsman should bear him,</span>
<span>No web of treachery weave for another,</span>
<span>Nor by cunning craftiness cause the destruction</span>
<span>Of trusty companion.  Most precious to Higelac,</span>
<span>The bold one in battle, was the bairn of his sister,</span>
<span>And each unto other mindful of favors.</span>
<span>I am told that to Hygd he proffered the necklace,</span>
<span>Wonder-gem rare that Wealhtheow gave him,</span>
<span>The troop-leader’s daughter, a trio of horses</span>
<span>Slender and saddle-bright; soon did the jewel</span>
<span>Embellish her bosom, when the beer-feast was over.</span>
<span>So Ecgtheow’s bairn brave did prove him,</span>
<span>War-famous man, by deeds that were valiant,</span>
<span>He lived in honor, belovèd companions</span>
<span>Slew not carousing; his mood was not cruel,</span>
<span>But by hand-strength hugest of heroes then living</span>
<span>The brave one retained the bountiful gift that</span>
<span>The Lord had allowed him. Long was he wretched,</span>
<span>So that sons of the Geatmen accounted him worthless,</span>
<span>And the lord of the liegemen loth was to do him</span>
<span>Mickle of honor, when mead-cups were passing;</span>
<span>They fully believed him idle and sluggish,</span>
<span>An indolent atheling: to the honor-blest man there</span>
<span>Came requital for the cuts he had suffered.</span>
<span>The folk-troop’s defender bade fetch to the building</span>
<span>The heirloom of Hrethel, embellished with gold,</span>
<span>So the brave one enjoined it; there was jewel no richer</span>
<span>In the form of a weapon ’mong Geats of that era;</span>
<span>In Beowulf’s keeping he placed it and gave him</span>
<span>Seven of thousands, manor and lordship.</span>
<span>Common to both was land ’mong the people,</span>
<span>Estate and inherited rights and possessions,</span>
<span>To the second one specially spacious dominions,</span>
<span>To the one who was better. It afterward happened</span>
<span>In days that followed, befell the battle-thanes,</span>
<span>After Higelac’s death, and when Heardred was murdered</span>
<span>With weapons of warfare ’neath well-covered targets,</span>
<span>When valiant battlemen in victor-band sought him,</span>
<span>War-Scylfing heroes harassed the nephew</span>
<span>Of Hereric in battle. To Beowulf’s keeping</span>
<span>Turned there in time extensive dominions:</span>
<span>He fittingly ruled them a fifty of winters</span>
<span>(He a man-ruler wise was, manor-ward old) till</span>
<span>A certain one ’gan, on gloom-darkening nights, a</span>
<span>Dragon, to govern, who guarded a treasure,</span>
<span>A high-rising stone-cliff, on heath that was grayish:</span>
<span>A path ’neath it lay, unknown unto mortals.</span>
<span>Some one of earthmen entered the mountain,</span>
<span>The heathenish hoard laid hold of with ardor;</span>
