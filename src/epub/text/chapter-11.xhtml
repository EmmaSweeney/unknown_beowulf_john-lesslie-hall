<h2>
<span>XI.</span>
<span>ALL SLEEP SAVE ONE.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.1">Then Hrothgar departed, his earl-throng attending him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.2">Folk-lord of Scyldings, forth from the building;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.3">The war-chieftain wished then Wealhtheow to look for,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.4">The queen for a bedmate. To keep away Grendel</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.5">The Glory of Kings had given a hall-watch,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.6">As men heard recounted: for the king of the Danemen</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.7">He did special service, gave the giant a watcher:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.8">And the prince of the Geatmen implicitly trusted</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.9">His warlike strength and the Wielder’s protection.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.10">His armor of iron off him he did then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.11">His helmet from his head, to his henchman committed</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.12">His chased-handled chain-sword, choicest of weapons,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.13">And bade him bide with his battle-equipments.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.14">The good one then uttered words of defiance,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.15">Beowulf Geatman, ere his bed he upmounted:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.16">“I hold me no meaner in matters of prowess,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.17">In warlike achievements, than Grendel does himself;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.18">Hence I seek not with sword-edge to sooth him to slumber,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.19">Of life to bereave him, though well I am able.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.20">No battle-skill has he, that blows he should strike me,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.21">To shatter my shield, though sure he is mighty</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.22">In strife and destruction; but struggling by night we</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.23">Shall do without edges, dare he to look for</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.24">Weaponless warfare, and wise-mooded Father</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.25">The glory apportion, God ever-holy,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.26">On which hand soever to him seemeth proper.”</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.27">Then the brave-mooded hero bent to his slumber,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.28">The pillow received the cheek of the noble;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.29">And many a martial mere-thane attending</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.30">Sank to his slumber. Seemed it unlikely</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.31">That ever thereafter any should hope to</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.32">Be happy at home, hero-friends visit</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.33">Or the lordly troop-castle where he lived from his childhood;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.34">They had heard how slaughter had snatched from the wine-hall,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.35">Had recently ravished, of the race of the Scyldings</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.36">Too many by far. But the Lord to them granted</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.37">The weaving of war-speed, to Wederish heroes</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.38">Aid and comfort, that every opponent</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.39">By one man’s war-might they worsted and vanquished,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.40">By the might of himself; the truth is established</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.41">That God Almighty hath governed for ages</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.42">Kindreds and nations. A night very lurid</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.43">The trav’ler-at-twilight came tramping and striding.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.44">The warriors were sleeping who should watch the horned-building,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.45">One only excepted. ’Mid earthmen ’twas ’stablished,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.46">Th’ implacable foeman was powerless to hurl them</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.47">To the land of shadows, if the Lord were unwilling;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.48">But serving as warder, in terror to foemen,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XI.49">He angrily bided the issue of battle.</div>
