<h2>
<span>XXV.</span>
<span>BEOWULF BRINGS HIS TROPHIES.—HROTHGAR’S GRATITUDE.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>Beowulf spake, offspring of Ecgtheow:</span>
<span>“Lo! we blithely have brought thee, bairn of Healfdene,</span>
<span>Prince of the Scyldings, these presents from ocean</span>
<span>Which thine eye looketh on, for an emblem of glory.</span>
<span>I came off alive from this, narrowly ’scaping:</span>
<span>In war ’neath the water the work with great pains I</span>
<span>Performed, and the fight had been finished quite nearly,</span>
<span>Had God not defended me. I failed in the battle</span>
<span>Aught to accomplish, aided by Hrunting,</span>
<span>Though that weapon was worthy, but the Wielder of earth-folk</span>
<span>Gave me willingly to see on the wall a</span>
<span>Heavy old hand-sword hanging in splendor</span>
<span>(He guided most often the lorn and the friendless),</span>
<span>That I swung as a weapon. The wards of the house then</span>
<span>I killed in the conflict (when occasion was given me).</span>
<span>Then the battle-sword burned, the brand that was lifted,</span>
<span>As the blood-current sprang, hottest of war-sweats;</span>
<span>Seizing the hilt, from my foes I offbore it;</span>
<span>I avenged as I ought to their acts of malignity,</span>
<span>The murder of Danemen. I then make thee this promise,</span>
<span>Thou’lt be able in Heorot careless to slumber</span>
<span>With thy throng of heroes and the thanes of thy people</span>
<span>Every and each, of greater and lesser,</span>
<span>And thou needest not fear for them from the selfsame direction</span>
<span>As thou formerly fearedst, oh, folk-lord of Scyldings,</span>
<span>End-day for earlmen.” To the age-hoary man then,</span>
<span>The gray-haired chieftain, the gold-fashioned sword-hilt,</span>
<span>Old-work of giants, was thereupon given;</span>
<span>Since the fall of the fiends, it fell to the keeping</span>
<span>Of the wielder of Danemen, the wonder-smith’s labor,</span>
<span>And the bad-mooded being abandoned this world then,</span>
<span>Opponent of God, victim of murder,</span>
<span>And also his mother; it went to the keeping</span>
<span>Of the best of the world-kings, where waters encircle,</span>
<span>Who the scot divided in Scylding dominion.</span>
<span>Hrothgar discoursed, the hilt he regarded,</span>
<span>The ancient heirloom where an old-time contention’s</span>
<span>Beginning was graven: the gurgling currents,</span>
<span>The flood slew thereafter the race of the giants,</span>
<span>They had proved themselves daring: that people was loth to</span>
<span>The Lord everlasting, through lash of the billows</span>
<span>The Father gave them final requital.</span>
<span>So in letters of rune on the clasp of the handle</span>
<span>Gleaming and golden, ’twas graven exactly,</span>
<span>Set forth and said, whom that sword had been made for,</span>
<span>Finest of irons, who first it was wrought for,</span>
<span>Wreathed at its handle and gleaming with serpents.</span>
<span>The wise one then said (silent they all were)</span>
<span>Son of old Healfdene: “He may say unrefuted</span>
<span>Who performs ’mid the folk-men fairness and truth</span>
<span>(The hoary old ruler remembers the past),</span>
<span>That better by birth is this bairn of the nobles!</span>
<span>Thy fame is extended through far-away countries,</span>
<span>Good friend Beowulf, o’er all of the races,</span>
<span>Thou holdest all firmly, hero-like strength with</span>
<span>Prudence of spirit. I’ll prove myself grateful</span>
<span>As before we agreed on; thou granted for long shalt</span>
<span>Become a great comfort to kinsmen and comrades,</span>
<span>A help unto heroes. Heremod became not</span>
<span>Such to the Scyldings, successors of Ecgwela;</span>
<span>He grew not to please them, but grievous destruction,</span>
<span>And diresome death-woes to Danemen attracted;</span>
<span>He slew in anger his table-companions,</span>
<span>Trustworthy counsellors, till he turned off lonely</span>
<span>From world-joys away, wide-famous ruler:</span>
<span>Though high-ruling heaven in hero-strength raised him,</span>
<span>In might exalted him, o’er men of all nations</span>
<span>Made him supreme, yet a murderous spirit</span>
<span>Grew in his bosom: he gave then no ring-gems</span>
<span>To the Danes after custom; endured he unjoyful</span>
<span>Standing the straits from strife that was raging,</span>
<span>Longsome folk-sorrow. Learn then from this,</span>
<span>Lay hold of virtue! Though laden with winters,</span>
<span>I have sung thee these measures. ’Tis a marvel to tell it,</span>
<span>How all-ruling God from greatness of spirit</span>
<span>Giveth wisdom to children of men,</span>
<span>Manor and earlship: all things He ruleth.</span>
<span>He often permitteth the mood-thought of man of</span>
<span>The illustrious lineage to lean to possessions,</span>
<span>Allows him earthly delights at his manor,</span>
<span>A high-burg of heroes to hold in his keeping,</span>
<span>Maketh portions of earth-folk hear him,</span>
<span>And a wide-reaching kingdom so that, wisdom failing him,</span>
<span>He himself is unable to reckon its boundaries;</span>
<span>He liveth in luxury, little debars him,</span>
<span>Nor sickness nor age, no treachery-sorrow</span>
<span>Becloudeth his spirit, conflict nowhere,</span>
<span>No sword-hate, appeareth, but all of the world doth</span>
<span>Wend as he wisheth; the worse he knoweth not,</span>
<span>Till arrant arrogance inward pervading,</span>
<span>Waxeth and springeth, when the warder is sleeping,</span>
<span>The guard of the soul: with sorrows encompassed,</span>
<span>Too sound is his slumber, the slayer is near him,</span>
<span>Who with bow and arrow aimeth in malice.</span>
