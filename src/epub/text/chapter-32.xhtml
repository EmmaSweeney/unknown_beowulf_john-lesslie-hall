<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.3">But, for need very pressing, the servant of one of</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.4">The sons of the heroes hate-blows evaded,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.5">Seeking for shelter and the sin-driven warrior</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.6">Took refuge within there. He early looked in it,</div>

<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.9">*    *    *    *    *  when the onset surprised him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.10">He a gem-vessel saw there: many of suchlike</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.11">Ancient ornaments in the earth-cave were lying,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.12">As in days of yore some one of men of</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.13">Illustrious lineage, as a legacy monstrous,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.14">There had secreted them, careful and thoughtful,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.15">Dear-valued jewels. Death had offsnatched them,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.16">In the days of the past, and the one man moreover</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.17">Of the flower of the folk who fared there the longest,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.18">Was fain to defer it, friend-mourning warder,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.19">A little longer to be left in enjoyment</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.20">Of long-lasting treasure. A barrow all-ready</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.21">Stood on the plain the stream-currents nigh to,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.22">New by the ness-edge, unnethe of approaching:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.23">The keeper of rings carried within a</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.24">Ponderous deal of the treasure of nobles,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.25">Of gold that was beaten, briefly he spake then:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.26">“Hold thou, O Earth, now heroes no more may,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.27">The earnings of earlmen. Lo! erst in thy bosom</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.28">Worthy men won them; war-death hath ravished,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.29">Perilous life-bale, all my warriors,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.30">Liegemen belovèd, who this life have forsaken,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.31">Who hall-pleasures saw. No sword-bearer have I,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.32">And no one to burnish the gold-plated vessel,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.33">The high-valued beaker: my heroes are vanished.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.34">The hardy helmet behung with gilding</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.35">Shall be reaved of its riches: the ring-cleansers slumber</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.36">Who were charged to have ready visors-for-battle,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.37">And the burnie that bided in battle-encounter</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.38">O’er breaking of war-shields the bite of the edges</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.39">Moulds with the hero. The ring-twisted armor,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.40">Its lord being lifeless, no longer may journey</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.41">Hanging by heroes; harp-joy is vanished,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.42">The rapture of glee-wood, no excellent falcon</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.43">Swoops through the building, no swift-footed charger</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.44">Grindeth the gravel. A grievous destruction</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.45">No few of the world-folk widely hath scattered!”</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.46">So, woful of spirit one after all</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.47">Lamented mournfully, moaning in sadness</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.48">By day and by night, till death with its billows</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.49">Dashed on his spirit. Then the ancient dusk-scather</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.50">Found the great treasure standing all open,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.51">He who flaming and fiery flies to the barrows,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.52">Naked war-dragon, nightly escapeth</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.53">Encompassed with fire; men under heaven</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.54">Widely beheld him. ’Tis said that he looks for</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.55">The hoard in the earth, where old he is guarding</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.56">The heathenish treasure; he’ll be nowise the better.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.57">So three-hundred winters the waster of peoples</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.58">Held upon earth that excellent hoard-hall,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.59">Till the forementioned earlman angered him bitterly:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.60">The beat-plated beaker he bare to his chieftain</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.61">And fullest remission for all his remissness</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.62">Begged of his liegelord. Then the hoard was discovered,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.63">The treasure was taken, his petition was granted</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.64">The lorn-mooded liegeman. His lord regarded</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.65">The old-work of earth-folk—’twas the earliest occasion.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.66">When the dragon awoke, the strife was renewed there;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.67">He snuffed ’long the stone then, stout-hearted found he</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.68">The footprint of foeman; too far had he gone</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.69">With cunning craftiness close to the head of</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.70">The fire-spewing dragon. So undoomed he may ’scape from</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.71">Anguish and exile with ease who possesseth</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.72">The favor of Heaven. The hoard-warden eagerly</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.73">Searched o’er the ground then, would meet with the person</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.74">That caused him sorrow while in slumber reclining:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.75">Gleaming and wild he oft went round the cavern,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.76">All of it outward; not any of earthmen</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.77">Was seen in that desert. Yet he joyed in the battle,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.78">Rejoiced in the conflict: oft he turned to the barrow,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.79">Sought for the gem-cup; this he soon perceived then</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.80">That some man or other had discovered the gold,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.81">The famous folk-treasure. Not fain did the hoard-ward</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.82">Wait until evening; then the ward of the barrow</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.83">Was angry in spirit, the loathèd one wished to</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.84">Pay for the dear-valued drink-cup with fire.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.85">Then the day was done as the dragon would have it,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.86">He no longer would wait on the wall, but departed</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.87">Fire-impelled, flaming. Fearful the start was</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.88">To earls in the land, as it early thereafter</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXXII.89">To their giver-of-gold was grievously ended.</div>
