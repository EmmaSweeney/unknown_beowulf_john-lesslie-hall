				<p>					<span>* * * * * * *</span>
					<span>He sought of himself who sorely did harm him,</span>
					<span>But, for need very pressing, the servant of one of</span>
					<span>The sons of the heroes hate-blows evaded,</span>
					<span>Seeking for shelter and the sin-driven warrior</span>
					<span>Took refuge within there. He early looked in it,</span>
					<span>* * * * * * *</span>
					<span>* * * * * * *</span>
					<span>* * * * * when the onset surprised him,</span>
					<span>He a gem-vessel saw there: many of suchlike</span>
					<span>Ancient ornaments in the earth-cave were lying,</span>
					<span>As in days of yore some one of men of</span>
					<span>Illustrious lineage, as a legacy monstrous,</span>
					<span>There had secreted them, careful and thoughtful,</span>
					<span>Dear-valued jewels. Death had offsnatched them,</span>
					<span>In the days of the past, and the one man moreover</span>
					<span>Of the flower of the folk who fared there the longest,</span>
					<span>Was fain to defer it, friend-mourning warder,</span>
					<span>A little longer to be left in enjoyment</span>
					<span>Of long-lasting treasure. A barrow all-ready</span>
					<span>Stood on the plain the stream-currents nigh to,</span>
					<span>New by the ness-edge, unnethe of approaching:</span>
					<span>The keeper of rings carried within a</span>
					<span>Ponderous deal of the treasure of nobles,</span>
					<span>Of gold that was beaten, briefly he spake then:</span>
					<span>“Hold thou, O Earth, now heroes no more may,</span>
					<span>The earnings of earlmen. Lo! erst in thy bosom</span>
					<span>Worthy men won them; war-death hath ravished,</span>
					<span>Perilous life-bale, all my warriors,</span>
					<span>Liegemen belovèd, who this life have forsaken,</span>
					<span>Who hall-pleasures saw. No sword-bearer have I,</span>
					<span>And no one to burnish the gold-plated vessel,</span>
					<span>The high-valued beaker: my heroes are vanished.</span>
					<span>The hardy helmet behung with gilding</span>
					<span>Shall be reaved of its riches: the ring-cleansers slumber</span>
					<span>Who were charged to have ready visors-for-battle,</span>
					<span>And the burnie that bided in battle-encounter</span>
					<span>O’er breaking of war-shields the bite of the edges</span>
					<span>Moulds with the hero. The ring-twisted armor,</span>
					<span>Its lord being lifeless, no longer may journey</span>
					<span>Hanging by heroes; harp-joy is vanished,</span>
					<span>The rapture of glee-wood, no excellent falcon</span>
					<span>Swoops through the building, no swift-footed charger</span>
					<span>Grindeth the gravel. A grievous destruction</span>
					<span>No few of the world-folk widely hath scattered!”</span>
					<span>So, woful of spirit one after all</span>
					<span>Lamented mournfully, moaning in sadness</span>
					<span>By day and by night, till death with its billows</span>
					<span>Dashed on his spirit. Then the ancient dusk-scather</span>
					<span>Found the great treasure standing all open,</span>
					<span>He who flaming and fiery flies to the barrows,</span>
					<span>Naked war-dragon, nightly escapeth</span>
					<span>Encompassed with fire; men under heaven</span>
					<span>Widely beheld him. ’Tis said that he looks for</span>
					<span>The hoard in the earth, where old he is guarding</span>
					<span>The heathenish treasure; he’ll be nowise the better.</span>
					<span>So three-hundred winters the waster of peoples</span>
					<span>Held upon earth that excellent hoard-hall,</span>
					<span>Till the forementioned earlman angered him bitterly:</span>
					<span>The beat-plated beaker he bare to his chieftain</span>
					<span>And fullest remission for all his remissness</span>
					<span>Begged of his liegelord. Then the hoard was discovered,</span>
					<span>The treasure was taken, his petition was granted</span>
					<span>The lorn-mooded liegeman. His lord regarded</span>
					<span>The old-work of earth-folk⁠—’twas the earliest occasion.</span>
					<span>When the dragon awoke, the strife was renewed there;</span>
					<span>He snuffed ’long the stone then, stout-hearted found he</span>
					<span>The footprint of foeman; too far had he gone</span>
					<span>With cunning craftiness close to the head of</span>
					<span>The fire-spewing dragon. So undoomed he may ’scape from</span>
					<span>Anguish and exile with ease who possesseth</span>
					<span>The favor of Heaven. The hoard-warden eagerly</span>
					<span>Searched o’er the ground then, would meet with the person</span>
					<span>That caused him sorrow while in slumber reclining:</span>
					<span>Gleaming and wild he oft went round the cavern,</span>
					<span>All of it outward; not any of earthmen</span>
					<span>Was seen in that desert. Yet he joyed in the battle,</span>
					<span>Rejoiced in the conflict: oft he turned to the barrow,</span>
					<span>Sought for the gem-cup; this he soon perceived then</span>
					<span>That some man or other had discovered the gold,</span>
					<span>The famous folk-treasure. Not fain did the hoard-ward</span>
					<span>Wait until evening; then the ward of the barrow</span>
					<span>Was angry in spirit, the loathèd one wished to</span>
					<span>Pay for the dear-valued drink-cup with fire.</span>
					<span>Then the day was done as the dragon would have it,</span>
					<span>He no longer would wait on the wall, but departed</span>
					<span>Fire-impelled, flaming. Fearful the start was</span>
					<span>To earls in the land, as it early thereafter</span>
					<span>To their giver-of-gold was grievously ended.</span>
