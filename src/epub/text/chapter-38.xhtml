				<p>					<span>Then heard I that Wihstan’s son very quickly,</span>
					<span>These words being uttered, heeded his liegelord</span>
					<span>Wounded and war-sick, went in his armor,</span>
					<span>His well-woven ring-mail, ’neath the roof of the barrow.</span>
					<span>Then the trusty retainer treasure-gems many</span>
					<span>Victorious saw, when the seat he came near to,</span>
					<span>Gold-treasure sparkling spread on the bottom,</span>
					<span>Wonder on the wall, and the worm-creature’s cavern,</span>
					<span>The ancient dawn-flier’s, vessels a-standing,</span>
					<span>Cups of the ancients of cleansers bereavèd,</span>
					<span>Robbed of their ornaments: there were helmets in numbers,</span>
					<span>Old and rust-eaten, arm-bracelets many,</span>
					<span>Artfully woven. Wealth can easily,</span>
					<span>Gold on the sea-bottom, turn into vanity</span>
					<span>Each one of earthmen, arm him who pleaseth!</span>
					<span>And he saw there lying an all-golden banner</span>
					<span>High o’er the hoard, of hand-wonders greatest,</span>
					<span>Linkèd with lacets: a light from it sparkled,</span>
					<span>That the floor of the cavern he was able to look on,</span>
					<span>To examine the jewels. Sight of the dragon</span>
					<span>Not any was offered, but edge offcarried him.</span>
					<span>Then I heard that the hero the hoard-treasure plundered,</span>
					<span>The giant-work ancient reaved in the cavern,</span>
					<span>Bare on his bosom the beakers and platters,</span>
					<span>As himself would fain have it, and took off the standard,</span>
					<span>The brightest of beacons; the bill had erst injured</span>
					<span>(Its edge was of iron), the old-ruler’s weapon,</span>
					<span>Him who long had watched as ward of the jewels,</span>
					<span>Who fire-terror carried hot for the treasure,</span>
					<span>Rolling in battle, in middlemost darkness,</span>
					<span>Till murdered he perished. The messenger hastened,</span>
					<span>Not loth to return, hurried by jewels:</span>
					<span>Curiosity urged him if, excellent-mooded,</span>
					<span>Alive he should find the lord of the Weders</span>
					<span>Mortally wounded, at the place where he left him.</span>
					<span>’Mid the jewels he found then the famous old chieftain,</span>
					<span>His liegelord belovèd, at his life’s-end gory:</span>
					<span>He thereupon ’gan to lave him with water,</span>
					<span>Till the point of his word piercèd his breast-hoard.</span>
					<span>Beowulf spake (the gold-gems he noticed),</span>
					<span>The old one in sorrow: “For the jewels I look on</span>
					<span>Thanks do I utter for all to the Ruler,</span>
					<span>Wielder of Worship, with words of devotion,</span>
					<span>The Lord everlasting, that He let me such treasures</span>
					<span>Gain for my people ere death overtook me.</span>
					<span>Since I’ve bartered the agèd life to me granted</span>
					<span>For treasure of jewels, attend ye henceforward</span>
					<span>The wants of the war-thanes; I can wait here no longer.</span>
					<span>The battle-famed bid ye to build them a grave-hill,</span>
					<span>Bright when I’m burned, at the brim-current’s limit;</span>
					<span>As a memory-mark to the men I have governed,</span>
					<span>Aloft it shall tower on Whale’s-Ness uprising,</span>
					<span>That earls of the ocean hereafter may call it</span>
					<span>Beowulf’s barrow, those who barks ever-dashing</span>
					<span>From a distance shall drive o’er the darkness of waters.”</span>
					<span>The bold-mooded troop-lord took from his neck then</span>
					<span>The ring that was golden, gave to his liegeman,</span>
					<span>The youthful war-hero, his gold-flashing helmet,</span>
					<span>His collar and war-mail, bade him well to enjoy them:</span>
					<span>“Thou art latest left of the line of our kindred,</span>
					<span>Of Wægmunding people: Weird hath offcarried</span>
					<span>All of my kinsmen to the Creator’s glory,</span>
					<span>Earls in their vigor: I shall after them fare.”</span>
					<span>’Twas the aged liegelord’s last-spoken word in</span>
					<span>His musings of spirit, ere he mounted the fire,</span>
					<span>The battle-waves burning: from his bosom departed</span>
					<span>His soul to seek the sainted ones’ glory.</span>
