				<p>					<span>He planned requital for the folk-leader’s ruin</span>
					<span>In days thereafter, to Eadgils the wretched</span>
					<span>Becoming an enemy. Ohthere’s son then</span>
					<span>Went with a war-troop o’er the wide-stretching currents</span>
					<span>With warriors and weapons: with woe-journeys cold he</span>
					<span>After avenged him, the king’s life he took.</span>
					<span>So he came off uninjured from all of his battles,</span>
					<span>Perilous fights, offspring of Ecgtheow,</span>
					<span>From his deeds of daring, till that day most momentous</span>
					<span>When he fate-driven fared to fight with the dragon.</span>
					<span>With eleven companions the prince of the Geatmen</span>
					<span>Went lowering with fury to look at the fire-drake:</span>
					<span>Inquiring he’d found how the feud had arisen,</span>
					<span>Hate to his heroes; the highly-famed gem-vessel</span>
					<span>Was brought to his keeping through the hand of th’ informer.</span>
					<span>That in the throng was thirteenth of heroes,</span>
					<span>That caused the beginning of conflict so bitter,</span>
					<span>Captive and wretched, must sad-mooded thenceward</span>
					<span>Point out the place: he passed then unwillingly</span>
					<span>To the spot where he knew of the notable cavern,</span>
					<span>The cave under earth, not far from the ocean,</span>
					<span>The anger of eddies, which inward was full of</span>
					<span>Jewels and wires: a warden uncanny,</span>
					<span>Warrior weaponed, wardered the treasure,</span>
					<span>Old under earth; no easy possession</span>
					<span>For any of earth-folk access to get to.</span>
					<span>Then the battle-brave atheling sat on the naze-edge,</span>
					<span>While the gold-friend of Geatmen gracious saluted</span>
					<span>His fireside-companions: woe was his spirit,</span>
					<span>Death-boding, wav’ring; Weird very near him,</span>
					<span>Who must seize the old hero, his soul-treasure look for,</span>
					<span>Dragging aloof his life from his body:</span>
					<span>Not flesh-hidden long was the folk-leader’s spirit.</span>
					<span>Beowulf spake, Ecgtheow’s son:</span>
					<span>“I survived in my youth-days many a conflict,</span>
					<span>Hours of onset: that all I remember.</span>
					<span>I was seven-winters old when the jewel-prince took me,</span>
					<span>High-lord of heroes, at the hands of my father,</span>
					<span>Hrethel the hero-king had me in keeping,</span>
					<span>Gave me treasure and feasting, our kinship remembered;</span>
					<span>Not ever was I <em>any</em> less dear to him</span>
					<span>Knight in the boroughs, than the bairns of his household,</span>
					<span>Herebald and Hæthcyn and Higelac mine.</span>
					<span>To the eldest unjustly by acts of a kinsman</span>
					<span>Was murder-bed strewn, since him Hæthcyn from horn-bow</span>
					<span>His sheltering chieftain shot with an arrow,</span>
					<span>Erred in his aim and injured his kinsman,</span>
					<span>One brother the other, with blood-sprinkled spear:</span>
					<span>’Twas a feeless fight, finished in malice,</span>
					<span>Sad to his spirit; the folk-prince however</span>
					<span>Had to part from existence with vengeance untaken.</span>
					<span>So to hoar-headed hero ’tis heavily crushing</span>
					<span>To live to see his son as he rideth</span>
					<span>Young on the gallows: then measures he chanteth,</span>
					<span>A song of sorrow, when his son is hanging</span>
					<span>For the raven’s delight, and aged and hoary</span>
					<span>He is unable to offer any assistance.</span>
					<span>Every morning his offspring’s departure</span>
					<span>Is constant recalled: he cares not to wait for</span>
					<span>The birth of an heir in his borough-enclosures,</span>
					<span>Since that one through death-pain the deeds hath experienced.</span>
					<span>He heart-grieved beholds in the house of his son the</span>
					<span>Wine-building wasted, the wind-lodging places</span>
					<span>Reaved of their roaring; the riders are sleeping,</span>
					<span>The knights in the grave; there’s no sound of the harp-wood,</span>
					<span>Joy in the yards, as of yore were familiar.</span>
