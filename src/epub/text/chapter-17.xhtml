<h2>
<span>XVII.</span>
<span>BANQUET (<i>continued</i>).—THE SCOP’S SONG OF FINN AND HNÆF.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>And the atheling of earlmen to each of the heroes</span>
<span>Who the ways of the waters went with Beowulf,</span>
<span>A costly gift-token gave on the mead-bench,</span>
<span>Offered an heirloom, and ordered that that man</span>
<span>With gold should be paid for, whom Grendel had erstwhile</span>
<span>Wickedly slaughtered, as he more of them had done</span>
<span>Had far-seeing God and the mood of the hero</span>
<span>The fate not averted: the Father then governed</span>
<span>All of the earth-dwellers, as He ever is doing;</span>
<span>Hence insight for all men is everywhere fittest,</span>
<span>Forethought of spirit! much he shall suffer</span>
<span>Of lief and of loathsome who long in this present</span>
<span>Useth the world in this woful existence.</span>
<span>There was music and merriment mingling together</span>
<span>Touching Healfdene’s leader; the joy-wood was fingered,</span>
<span>Measures recited, when the singer of Hrothgar</span>
<span>On mead-bench should mention the merry hall-joyance</span>
<span>Of the kinsmen of Finn, when onset surprised them:</span>
<span>“The Half-Danish hero, Hnæf of the Scyldings,</span>
<span>On the field of the Frisians was fated to perish.</span>
<span>Sure Hildeburg needed not mention approving</span>
<span>The faith of the Jutemen: though blameless entirely,</span>
<span>When shields were shivered she was shorn of her darlings,</span>
<span>Of bairns and brothers: they bent to their fate</span>
<span>With war-spear wounded; woe was that woman.</span>
<span>Not causeless lamented the daughter of Hoce</span>
<span>The decree of the Wielder when morning-light came and</span>
<span>She was able ’neath heaven to behold the destruction</span>
<span>Of brothers and bairns, where the brightest of earth-joys</span>
<span>She had hitherto had: all the henchmen of Finn</span>
<span>War had offtaken, save a handful remaining,</span>
<span>That he nowise was able to offer resistance</span>
<span>To the onset of Hengest in the parley of battle,</span>
<span>Nor the wretched remnant to rescue in war from</span>
<span>The earl of the atheling; but they offered conditions,</span>
<span>Another great building to fully make ready,</span>
<span>A hall and a high-seat, that half they might rule with</span>
<span>The sons of the Jutemen, and that Folcwalda’s son would</span>
<span>Day after day the Danemen honor</span>
<span>When gifts were giving, and grant of his ring-store</span>
<span>To Hengest’s earl-troop ever so freely,</span>
<span>Of his gold-plated jewels, as he encouraged the Frisians</span>
<span>On the bench of the beer-hall. On both sides they swore then</span>
<span>A fast-binding compact; Finn unto Hengest</span>
<span>With no thought of revoking vowed then most solemnly</span>
<span>The woe-begone remnant well to take charge of,</span>
<span>His Witan advising; the agreement should no one</span>
<span>By words or works weaken and shatter,</span>
<span>By artifice ever injure its value,</span>
<span>Though reaved of their ruler their ring-giver’s slayer</span>
<span>They followed as vassals, Fate so requiring:</span>
<span>Then if one of the Frisians the quarrel should speak of</span>
<span>In tones that were taunting, terrible edges</span>
<span>Should cut in requital. Accomplished the oath was,</span>
<span>And treasure of gold from the hoard was uplifted.</span>
<span>The best of the Scylding braves was then fully</span>
<span>Prepared for the pile; at the pyre was seen clearly</span>
<span>The blood-gory burnie, the boar with his gilding,</span>
<span>The iron-hard swine, athelings many</span>
<span>Fatally wounded; no few had been slaughtered.</span>
<span>Hildeburg bade then, at the burning of Hnæf,</span>
<span>The bairn of her bosom to bear to the fire,</span>
<span>That his body be burned and borne to the pyre.</span>
<span>The woe-stricken woman wept on his shoulder</span>
<span>In measures lamented; upmounted the hero.</span>
<span>The greatest of dead-fires curled to the welkin,</span>
<span>On the hill’s-front crackled; heads were a-melting,</span>
<span>Wound-doors bursting, while the blood was a-coursing</span>
<span>From body-bite fierce. The fire devoured them,</span>
<span>Greediest of spirits, whom war had offcarried</span>
<span>From both of the peoples; their bravest were fallen.</span>
