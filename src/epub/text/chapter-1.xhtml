<h2>
<span>I</span>
<span>THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SCYLD.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>Lo! the Spear-Danes’ glory through splendid achievements</span>
<span>The folk-kings’ former fame we have heard of,</span>
<div class="l" id="L.I.3">How princes displayed then their prowess-in-battle.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.4">Oft Scyld the Scefing from scathers in numbers</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.5">From many a people their mead-benches tore.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.6">Since first he found him friendless and wretched,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.7">The earl had had terror: comfort he got for it,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.8">Waxed ’neath the welkin, world-honor gained,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.9">Till all his neighbors o’er sea were compelled to</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.10">Bow to his bidding and bring him their tribute:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.11">An excellent atheling! After was borne him</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.12">A son and heir, young in his dwelling,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.13">Whom God-Father sent to solace the people.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.14">He had marked the misery malice had caused them,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.15">That reaved of their rulers they wretched had erstwhile</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.16">Long been afflicted. The Lord, in requital,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.17">Wielder of Glory, with world-honor blessed him.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.18">Famed was Beowulf, far spread the glory</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.19">Of Scyld’s great son in the lands of the Danemen.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.20">So the carle that is young, by kindnesses rendered</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.21">The friends of his father, with fees in abundance</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.22">Must be able to earn that when age approacheth</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.23">Eager companions aid him requitingly,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.24">When war assaults him serve him as liegemen:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.25">By praise-worthy actions must honor be got</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.26">’Mong all of the races. At the hour that was fated</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.27">Scyld then departed to the All-Father’s keeping</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.28">Warlike to wend him; away then they bare him</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.29">To the flood of the current, his fond-loving comrades,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.30">As himself he had bidden, while the friend of the Scyldings</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.31">Word-sway wielded, and the well-lovèd land-prince</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.32">Long did rule them. The ring-stemmèd vessel,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.33">Bark of the atheling, lay there at anchor,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.34">Icy in glimmer and eager for sailing;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.35">The belovèd leader laid they down there,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.36">Giver of rings, on the breast of the vessel,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.37">The famed by the mainmast. A many of jewels,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.38">Of fretted embossings, from far-lands brought over,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.39">Was placed near at hand then; and heard I not ever</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.40">That a folk ever furnished a float more superbly</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.41">With weapons of warfare, weeds for the battle,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.42">Bills and burnies; on his bosom sparkled</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.43">Many a jewel that with him must travel</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.44">On the flush of the flood afar on the current.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.45">And favors no fewer they furnished him soothly,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.46">Excellent folk-gems, than others had given him</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.47">Who when first he was born outward did send him</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.48">Lone on the main, the merest of infants:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.49">And a gold-fashioned standard they stretched under heaven</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.50">High o’er his head, let the holm-currents bear him,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.51">Seaward consigned him: sad was their spirit,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.52">Their mood very mournful. Men are not able</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.53">Soothly to tell us, they in halls who reside,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.I.54">Heroes under heaven, to what haven he hied.</div>
