<h2><span>XXIII.</span>
<span>BEOWULF’S FIGHT WITH GRENDEL’S MOTHER.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>Beowulf spake, Ecgtheow’s son:</span>
<span>“Recall now, oh, famous kinsman of Healfdene,</span>
<span>Prince very prudent, now to part I am ready,</span>
<span>Gold-friend of earlmen, what erst we agreed on,</span>
<span>Should I lay down my life in lending thee assistance,</span>
<span>When my earth-joys were over, thou wouldst evermore serve me</span>
<span>In stead of a father; my faithful thanemen,</span>
<span>My trusty retainers, protect thou and care for,</span>
<span>Fall I in battle: and, Hrothgar belovèd,</span>
<span>Send unto Higelac the high-valued jewels</span>
<span>Thou to me hast allotted. The lord of the Geatmen</span>
<span>May perceive from the gold, the Hrethling may see it</span>
<span>When he looks on the jewels, that a gem-giver found I</span>
<span>Good over-measure, enjoyed him while able.</span>
<span>And the ancient heirloom Unferth permit thou,</span>
<span>The famed one to have, the heavy-sword splendid</span>
<span>The hard-edgèd weapon; with Hrunting to aid me,</span>
<span>I shall gain me glory, or grim-death shall take me.”</span>
<span>The atheling of Geatmen uttered these words and</span>
<span>Heroic did hasten, not any rejoinder</span>
<span>Was willing to wait for; the wave-current swallowed</span>
<span>The doughty-in-battle. Then a day’s-length elapsed ere</span>
<span>He was able to see the sea at its bottom.</span>
<span>Early she found then who fifty of winters</span>
<span>The course of the currents kept in her fury,</span>
<span>Grisly and greedy, that the grim one’s dominion</span>
<span>Some one of men from above was exploring.</span>
<span>Forth did she grab them, grappled the warrior</span>
<span>With horrible clutches; yet no sooner she injured</span>
<span>His body unscathèd: the burnie out-guarded,</span>
<span>That she proved but powerless to pierce through the armor,</span>
<span>The limb-mail locked, with loath-grabbing fingers.</span>
<span>The sea-wolf bare then, when bottomward came she,</span>
<span>The ring-prince homeward, that he after was powerless</span>
<span>(He had daring to do it) to deal with his weapons,</span>
<span>But many a mere-beast tormented him swimming,</span>
<span>Flood-beasts no few with fierce-biting tusks did</span>
<span>Break through his burnie, the brave one pursued they.</span>
<span>The earl then discovered he was down in some cavern</span>
<span>Where no water whatever anywise harmed him,</span>
<span>And the clutch of the current could come not anear him,</span>
<span>Since the roofed-hall prevented; brightness a-gleaming</span>
<span>Fire-light he saw, flashing resplendent.</span>
<span>The good one saw then the sea-bottom’s monster,</span>
<span>The mighty mere-woman; he made a great onset</span>
<span>With weapon-of-battle, his hand not desisted</span>
<span>From striking, that war-blade struck on her head then</span>
<span>A battle-song greedy. The stranger perceived then</span>
<span>The sword would not bite, her life would not injure,</span>
<span>But the falchion failed the folk-prince when straitened:</span>
<span>Erst had it often onsets encountered,</span>
<span>Oft cloven the helmet, the fated one’s armor:</span>
<span>’Twas the first time that ever the excellent jewel</span>
<span>Had failed of its fame. Firm-mooded after,</span>
<span>Not heedless of valor, but mindful of glory,</span>
<span>Was Higelac’s kinsman; the hero-chief angry</span>
<span>Cast then his carved-sword covered with jewels</span>
<span>That it lay on the earth, hard and steel-pointed;</span>
<span>He hoped in his strength, his hand-grapple sturdy.</span>
<span>So any must act whenever he thinketh</span>
<span>To gain him in battle glory unending,</span>
<span>And is reckless of living. The lord of the War-Geats</span>
<span>(He shrank not from battle) seized by the shoulder</span>
<span>The mother of Grendel; then mighty in struggle</span>
<span>Swung he his enemy, since his anger was kindled,</span>
<span>That she fell to the floor. With furious grapple</span>
<span>She gave him requital early thereafter,</span>
<span>And stretched out to grab him; the strongest of warriors</span>
<span>Faint-mooded stumbled, till he fell in his traces,</span>
<span>Foot-going champion. Then she sat on the hall-guest</span>
<span>And wielded her war-knife wide-bladed, flashing,</span>
<span>For her son would take vengeance, her one only bairn.</span>
<span>His breast-armor woven bode on his shoulder;</span>
<span>It guarded his life, the entrance defended</span>
<span>’Gainst sword-point and edges. Ecgtheow’s son there</span>
<span>Had fatally journeyed, champion of Geatmen,</span>
<span>In the arms of the ocean, had the armor not given,</span>
<span>Close-woven corslet, comfort and succor,</span>
<span>And had God most holy not awarded the victory,</span>
<span>All-knowing Lord; easily did heaven’s</span>
<span>Ruler most righteous arrange it with justice;</span>
<span>Uprose he erect ready for battle.</span>
