<h2><span>XII.</span>
<span>GRENDEL AND BEOWULF.<span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>’Neath the cloudy cliffs came from the moor then</span>
<span>Grendel going, God’s anger bare he.</span>
<span>The monster intended some one of earthmen</span>
<span>In the hall-building grand to entrap and make way with:</span>
<span>He went under welkin where well he knew of</span>
<span>The wine-joyous building, brilliant with plating,</span>
<span>Gold-hall of earthmen. Not the earliest occasion</span>
<span>He the home and manor of Hrothgar had sought:</span>
<span>Ne’er found he in life-days later nor earlier</span>
<span>Hardier hero, hall-thanes more sturdy!</span>
<span>Then came to the building the warrior marching,</span>
<span>Bereft of his joyance. The door quickly opened</span>
<span>On fire-hinges fastened, when his fingers had touched it;</span>
<span>The fell one had flung then—his fury so bitter—</span>
<span>Open the entrance. Early thereafter</span>
<span>The foeman trod the shining hall-pavement,</span>
<span>Strode he angrily; from the eyes of him glimmered</span>
<span>A lustre unlovely likest to fire.</span>
<span>He beheld in the hall the heroes in numbers,</span>
<span>A circle of kinsmen sleeping together,</span>
<span>A throng of thanemen: then his thoughts were exultant,</span>
<span>He minded to sunder from each of the thanemen</span>
<span>The life from his body, horrible demon,</span>
<span>Ere morning came, since fate had allowed him</span>
<span>The prospect of plenty. Providence willed not</span>
<span>To permit him any more of men under heaven</span>
<span>To eat in the night-time. Higelac’s kinsman</span>
<span>Great sorrow endured how the dire-mooded creature</span>
<span>In unlooked-for assaults were likely to bear him.</span>
<span>No thought had the monster of deferring the matter,</span>
<span>But on earliest occasion he quickly laid hold of</span>
<span>A soldier asleep, suddenly tore him,</span>
<span>Bit his bone-prison, the blood drank in currents,</span>
<span>Swallowed in mouthfuls: he soon had the dead man’s</span>
<span>Feet and hands, too, eaten entirely.</span>
<span>Nearer he strode then, the stout-hearted warrior</span>
<span>Snatched as he slumbered, seizing with hand-grip,</span>
<span>Forward the foeman foined with his hand;</span>
<span>Caught he quickly the cunning deviser,</span>
<span>On his elbow he rested. This early discovered</span>
<span>The master of malice, that in middle-earth’s regions,</span>
<span>’Neath the whole of the heavens, no hand-grapple greater</span>
<span>In any man else had he ever encountered:</span>
<span>Fearful in spirit, faint-mooded waxed he,</span>
<span>Not off could betake him; death he was pondering,</span>
<span>Would fly to his covert, seek the devils’ assembly:</span>
<span>His calling no more was the same he had followed</span>
<span>Long in his lifetime. The liege-kinsman worthy</span>
<span>Of Higelac minded his speech of the evening,</span>
<span>Stood he up straight and stoutly did seize him.</span>
<span>His fingers crackled; the giant was outward,</span>
<span>The earl stepped farther. The famous one minded</span>
<span>To flee away farther, if he found an occasion,</span>
<span>And off and away, avoiding delay,</span>
<span>To fly to the fen-moors; he fully was ware of</span>
<span>The strength of his grapple in the grip of the foeman.</span>
<span>’Twas an ill-taken journey that the injury-bringing,</span>
<span>Harrying harmer to Heorot wandered:</span>
<span>The palace re-echoed; to all of the Danemen,</span>
<span>Dwellers in castles, to each of the bold ones,</span>
<span>Earlmen, was terror. Angry they both were,</span>
<span>Archwarders raging. Rattled the building;</span>
<span>’Twas a marvellous wonder that the wine-hall withstood then</span>
<span>The bold-in-battle, bent not to earthward,</span>
<span>Excellent earth-hall; but within and without it</span>
<span>Was fastened so firmly in fetters of iron,</span>
<span>By the art of the armorer. Off from the sill there</span>
<span>Bent mead-benches many, as men have informed me,</span>
<span>Adorned with gold-work, where the grim ones did struggle.</span>
<span>The Scylding wise men weened ne’er before</span>
<span>That by might and main-strength a man under heaven</span>
<span>Might break it in pieces, bone-decked, resplendent,</span>
<span>Crush it by cunning, unless clutch of the fire</span>
<span>In smoke should consume it. The sound mounted upward</span>
<span>Novel enough; on the North Danes fastened</span>
<span>A terror of anguish, on all of the men there</span>
<span>Who heard from the wall the weeping and plaining,</span>
<span>The song of defeat from the foeman of heaven,</span>
<span>Heard him hymns of horror howl, and his sorrow</span>
<span>Hell-bound bewailing. He held him too firmly</span>
<span>Who was strongest of main-strength of men of that era.</span>
