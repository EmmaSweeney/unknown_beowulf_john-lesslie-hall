<span>XXI.</span>
<span>HROTHGAR’S ACCOUNT OF THE MONSTERS.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.1">Hrothgar rejoined, helm of the Scyldings:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.2">“Ask not of joyance! Grief is renewed to</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.3">The folk of the Danemen. Dead is Æschere,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.4">Yrmenlaf’s brother, older than he,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.5">My true-hearted counsellor, trusty adviser,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.6">Shoulder-companion, when fighting in battle</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.7">Our heads we protected, when troopers were clashing,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.8">And heroes were dashing; such an earl should be ever,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.9">An erst-worthy atheling, as Æschere proved him.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.10">The flickering death-spirit became in Heorot</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.11">His hand-to-hand murderer; I can not tell whither</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.12">The cruel one turned in the carcass exulting,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.13">By cramming discovered. The quarrel she wreaked then,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.14">That last night igone Grendel thou killedst</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.15">In grewsomest manner, with grim-holding clutches,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.16">Since too long he had lessened my liege-troop and wasted</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.17">My folk-men so foully. He fell in the battle</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.18">With forfeit of life, and another has followed,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.19">A mighty crime-worker, her kinsman avenging,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.20">And henceforth hath ‘stablished her hatred unyielding,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.21">As it well may appear to many a liegeman,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.22">Who mourneth in spirit the treasure-bestower,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.23">Her heavy heart-sorrow; the hand is now lifeless</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.24">Which availed you in every wish that you cherished.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.25">Land-people heard I, liegemen, this saying,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.26">Dwellers in halls, they had seen very often</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.27">A pair of such mighty march-striding creatures,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.28">Far-dwelling spirits, holding the moorlands:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.29">One of them wore, as well they might notice,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.30">The image of woman, the other one wretched</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.31">In guise of a man wandered in exile,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.32">Except he was huger than any of earthmen;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.33">Earth-dwelling people entitled him Grendel</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.34">In days of yore: they know not their father,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.35">Whe’r ill-going spirits any were borne him</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.36">Ever before. They guard the wolf-coverts,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.37">Lands inaccessible, wind-beaten nesses,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.38">Fearfullest fen-deeps, where a flood from the mountains</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.39">’Neath mists of the nesses netherward rattles,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.40">The stream under earth: not far is it henceward</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.41">Measured by mile-lengths that the mere-water standeth,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.42">Which forests hang over, with frost-whiting covered,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.43">A firm-rooted forest, the floods overshadow.</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.44">There ever at night one an ill-meaning portent</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.45">A fire-flood may see; ’mong children of men</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.46">None liveth so wise that wot of the bottom;</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.47">Though harassed by hounds the heath-stepper seek for,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.48">Fly to the forest, firm-antlered he-deer,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.49">Spurred from afar, his spirit he yieldeth,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.50">His life on the shore, ere in he will venture</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.51">To cover his head. Uncanny the place is:</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.52">Thence upward ascendeth the surging of waters,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.53">Wan to the welkin, when the wind is stirring</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.54">The weathers unpleasing, till the air groweth gloomy,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.55">And the heavens lower. Now is help to be gotten</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.56">From thee and thee only! The abode thou know’st not,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.57">The dangerous place where thou’rt able to meet with</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.58">The sin-laden hero: seek if thou darest!</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.59">For the feud I will fully fee thee with money,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.60">With old-time treasure, as erstwhile I did thee,</div>
<div class="l" id="L.XXI.61">With well-twisted jewels, if away thou shalt get thee.”</div>
