				<p>					<span>A beaker was borne him, and bidding to quaff it</span>
					<span>Graciously given, and gold that was twisted</span>
					<span>Pleasantly proffered, a pair of arm-jewels,</span>
					<span>Rings and corslet, of collars the greatest</span>
					<span>I’ve heard of ’neath heaven. Of heroes not any</span>
					<span>More splendid from jewels have I heard ’neath the welkin,</span>
					<span>Since Hama off bore the Brosingmen’s necklace,</span>
					<span>The bracteates and jewels, from the bright-shining city,</span>
					<span>Eormenric’s cunning craftiness fled from,</span>
					<span>Chose gain everlasting. Geatish Higelac,</span>
					<span>Grandson of Swerting, last had this jewel</span>
					<span>When tramping ’neath banner the treasure he guarded,</span>
					<span>The field-spoil defended; Fate offcarried him</span>
					<span>When for deeds of daring he endured tribulation,</span>
					<span>Hate from the Frisians; the ornaments bare he</span>
					<span>O’er the cup of the currents, costly gem-treasures,</span>
					<span>Mighty folk-leader, he fell ’neath his target;</span>
					<span>The corpse of the king then came into charge of</span>
					<span>The race of the Frankmen, the mail-shirt and collar:</span>
					<span>Warmen less noble plundered the fallen,</span>
					<span>When the fight was finished; the folk of the Geatmen</span>
					<span>The field of the dead held in possession.</span>
					<span>The choicest of mead-halls with cheering resounded.</span>
					<span>Wealhtheo discoursed, the war-troop addressed she:</span>
					<span>“This collar enjoy thou, Beowulf worthy,</span>
					<span>Young man, in safety, and use thou this armor,</span>
					<span>Gems of the people, and prosper thou fully,</span>
					<span>Show thyself sturdy and be to these liegemen</span>
					<span>Mild with instruction! I’ll mind thy requital.</span>
					<span>Thou hast brought it to pass that far and near</span>
					<span>Forever and ever earthmen shall honor thee,</span>
					<span>Even so widely as ocean surroundeth</span>
					<span>The blustering bluffs. Be, while thou livest,</span>
					<span>A wealth-blessèd atheling. I wish thee most truly</span>
					<span>Jewels and treasure. Be kind to my son, thou</span>
					<span>Living in joyance! Here each of the nobles</span>
					<span>Is true unto other, gentle in spirit,</span>
					<span>Loyal to leader. The liegemen are peaceful,</span>
					<span>The war-troops ready: well-drunken heroes,</span>
					<span>Do as I bid ye.” Then she went to the settle.</span>
					<span>There was choicest of banquets, wine drank the heroes:</span>
					<span>Weird they knew not, destiny cruel,</span>
					<span>As to many an earlman early it happened,</span>
					<span>When evening had come and Hrothgar had parted</span>
					<span>Off to his manor, the mighty to slumber.</span>
					<span>Warriors unnumbered warded the building</span>
					<span>As erst they did often: the ale-settle bared they,</span>
					<span>’Twas covered all over with beds and pillows.</span>
					<span>Doomed unto death, down to his slumber</span>
					<span>Bowed then a beer-thane. Their battle-shields placed they,</span>
					<span>Bright-shining targets, up by their heads then;</span>
					<span>O’er the atheling on ale-bench ’twas easy to see there</span>
					<span>Battle-high helmet, burnie of ring-mail,</span>
					<span>And mighty war-spear. ’Twas the wont of that people</span>
					<span>To constantly keep them equipped for the battle,</span>
					<span>At home or marching⁠—in either condition⁠—</span>
					<span>At seasons just such as necessity ordered</span>
					<span>As best for their ruler; that people was worthy.</span>
