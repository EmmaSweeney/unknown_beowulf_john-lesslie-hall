<h2>
<span>XXIX.</span>
<span>BEOWULF AND HIGELAC.</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>Then the brave one departed, his band along with him,</span>
<span>Seeking the sea-shore, the sea-marches treading,</span>
<span>The wide-stretching shores. The world-candle glimmered,</span>
<span>The sun from the southward; they proceeded then onward,</span>
<span>Early arriving where they heard that the troop-lord,</span>
<span>Ongentheow’s slayer, excellent, youthful</span>
<span>Folk-prince and warrior was distributing jewels,</span>
<span>Close in his castle. The coming of Beowulf</span>
<span>Was announced in a message quickly to Higelac,</span>
<span>That the folk-troop’s defender forth to the palace</span>
<span>The linden-companion alive was advancing,</span>
<span>Secure from the combat courtward a-going.</span>
<span>The building was early inward made ready</span>
<span>For the foot-going guests as the good one had ordered.</span>
<span>He sat by the man then who had lived through the struggle,</span>
<span>Kinsman by kinsman, when the king of the people</span>
<span>Had in lordly language saluted the dear one,</span>
<span>In words that were formal. The daughter of Hæreth</span>
<span>Coursed through the building, carrying mead-cups:</span>
<span>She loved the retainers, tendered the beakers</span>
<span>To the high-minded Geatmen. Higelac ’gan then</span>
<span>Pleasantly plying his companion with questions</span>
<span>In the high-towering palace. A curious interest</span>
<span>Tormented his spirit, what meaning to see in</span>
<span>The Sea-Geats’ adventures: “Beowulf worthy,</span>
<span>How throve your journeying, when thou thoughtest suddenly</span>
<span>Far o’er the salt-streams to seek an encounter,</span>
<span>A battle at Heorot? Hast bettered for Hrothgar,</span>
<span>The famous folk-leader, his far-published sorrows</span>
<span>Any at all? In agony-billows</span>
<span>I mused upon torture, distrusted the journey</span>
<span>Of the belovèd liegeman; I long time did pray thee</span>
<span>By no means to seek out the murderous spirit,</span>
<span>To suffer the South-Danes themselves to decide on</span>
<span>Grappling with Grendel. To God I am thankful</span>
<span>To be suffered to see thee safe from thy journey.”</span>
<span>Beowulf answered, bairn of old Ecgtheow:</span>
<span>“’Tis hidden by no means, Higelac chieftain,</span>
<span>From many of men, the meeting so famous,</span>
<span>What mournful moments of me and of Grendel</span>
<span>Were passed in the place where he pressing affliction</span>
<span>On the Victory-Scyldings scathefully brought,</span>
<span>Anguish forever; that all I avengèd,</span>
<span>So that any under heaven of the kinsmen of Grendel</span>
<span>Needeth not boast of that cry-in-the-morning,</span>
<span>Who longest liveth of the loth-going kindred,</span>
<span>Encompassed by moorland. I came in my journey</span>
<span>To the royal ring-hall, Hrothgar to greet there:</span>
<span>Soon did the famous scion of Healfdene,</span>
<span>When he understood fully the spirit that led me,</span>
<span>Assign me a seat with the son of his bosom.</span>
<span>The troop was in joyance; mead-glee greater</span>
<span>’Neath arch of the ether not ever beheld I</span>
<span>’Mid hall-building holders. The highly-famed queen,</span>
<span>Peace-tie of peoples, oft passed through the building,</span>
<span>Cheered the young troopers; she oft tendered a hero</span>
<span>A beautiful ring-band, ere she went to her sitting.</span>
<span>Oft the daughter of Hrothgar in view of the courtiers</span>
<span>To the earls at the end the ale-vessel carried,</span>
<span>Whom Freaware I heard then hall-sitters title,</span>
<span>When nail-adorned jewels she gave to the heroes:</span>
<span>Gold-bedecked, youthful, to the glad son of Froda</span>
<span>Her faith has been plighted; the friend of the Scyldings,</span>
<span>The guard of the kingdom, hath given his sanction,</span>
<span>And counts it a vantage, for a part of the quarrels,</span>
<span>A portion of hatred, to pay with the woman.</span>
<span>Somewhere not rarely, when the ruler has fallen,</span>
<span>The life-taking lance relaxeth its fury</span>
<span>For a brief breathing-spell, though the bride be charming!</span>
